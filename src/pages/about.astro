      <h2>What Is This?</h2>
      <p>
        Epstein Transparency Act is a factual, noise-free database tracking
        developments around the Epstein Files and the Epstein Transparency Act.
        We aggregate reporting from major news outlets and present it in a
        clear, searchable format.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pure aggregation.</strong> We summarize and link to original reporting from
          outlets like Reuters, AP, NYT, BBC, and The Guardian. No opinion or commentary.</li>
        <li><strong>Source attribution.</strong> Every article links back to its original source.
          We do not claim to produce original reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>People database.</strong> We maintain profiles of individuals named in
          documents, officials, and other connected parties, with bidirectional
          links to relevant news coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeline.</strong> A chronological record of key events in the case.</li>
      </ul>

        outlets. Inclusion of any individual in the people database does not
