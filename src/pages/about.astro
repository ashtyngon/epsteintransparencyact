      <h2>What Is This?</h2>
      <p>
        The Epstein Transparency Project tracks every development around the
        Epstein Files and the Epstein Transparency Act. We present the facts
        in a clear, organized format so the public can follow this story without
        wading through noise.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Source-first.</strong> Every piece on this site links directly
        to its original source. We believe in full attribution — readers should
        always be able to verify what they read.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>People database.</strong> We maintain profiles of individuals named in
        the documents, along with officials, associates, and other connected parties.
        Each profile is cross-referenced with all related coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Timeline.</strong> A chronological record of key events in the case,
        from the earliest allegations through the latest document releases and legislative action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Continuous updates.</strong> We track the latest developments as they
        happen, so you don't have to piece the story together yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        This site presents publicly available information from established reporting
        and public records. Inclusion of any individual in the people database does not
        imply guilt or wrongdoing.
