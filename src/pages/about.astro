      <h2>What Is This?</h2>
      <p>
        The Epstein Transparency Project is a comprehensive database tracking
        every development around the Epstein Files and the Epstein Transparency Act.
        We aggregate reporting from major news outlets and present it in a
        clear, searchable format so the public can follow this story without wading
        through noise.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Source-first reporting.</strong> Every article on this site links directly
        to its original source. We track coverage from Reuters, AP, The New York Times,
        BBC, The Guardian, CNN, The Washington Post, and dozens more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>People database.</strong> We maintain profiles of individuals named in
        the documents, along with officials, associates, and other connected parties.
        Each profile is cross-referenced with all related news coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Timeline.</strong> A chronological record of key events in the case,
        from the earliest allegations through the latest document releases and legislative action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Automated pipeline.</strong> Our system monitors RSS feeds from 24+ major
        news outlets every four hours, filtering for relevant stories and generating
        fact-checked summaries with full source attribution.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        This site aggregates publicly available reporting from established news
        outlets. Inclusion of any individual in the people database does not
        imply guilt or wrongdoing. All information is sourced from public records
        and published reporting.
