Thomas Massie is a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Kentucky's 4th congressional district since 2012. A libertarian-leaning engineer and farmer known for his independence from party leadership, Massie became the legislative architect of the Epstein transparency movement — co-authoring the Epstein Transparency Act, leading the discharge petition that forced it to the floor, and emerging as one of the most persistent voices for full disclosure.

## Political Background

Massie holds a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from MIT. He built a technology company before entering politics and has represented a rural Kentucky district since winning a special election in 2012. He has frequently been the lone Republican vote against party-line legislation, earning a reputation as a principled contrarian willing to break with leadership on constitutional and transparency grounds.

This independence positioned Massie to lead a bipartisan effort that the Republican leadership and the White House actively opposed.

## Co-Authoring the Epstein Transparency Act

In July 2025, Massie and Rep. [Ro Khanna](/people/ro-khanna) (D-CA) introduced the Epstein Transparency Act. The bill was modeled on the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which established a framework for declassifying and releasing government records related to the Kennedy assassination.

The Epstein Transparency Act required federal agencies to identify, collect, and publicly release all records related to [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein), with narrow exemptions for active law enforcement operations and victim privacy. The bipartisan authorship — a libertarian Republican and a progressive Democrat — was deliberate, designed to insulate the bill from partisan framing.

## The Discharge Petition

When the House Judiciary Committee, under pressure from the White House, declined to schedule a markup of the bill, Massie filed a discharge petition on September 2, 2025. A discharge petition is a rarely successful procedural mechanism requiring 218 signatures — a majority of the House — to bypass committee leadership and bring a bill directly to the floor.

Massie signed first. Three other Republicans — [Marjorie Taylor Greene](/people/marjorie-taylor-greene), [Lauren Boebert](/people/lauren-boebert), and [Nancy Mace](/people/nancy-mace) — signed the same day. Combined with unified Democratic support, the four Republican signatures put the petition on a path to 218.

The White House response was immediate. A formal statement labeled Republican support for the petition "a very hostile act to the administration." [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump) un-endorsed Greene and attacked the signatories publicly. Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the swearing-in of Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ), whose special election victory would provide the 218th signature.

Massie was public about the pressure he faced but did not waver. He framed the issue as a straightforward matter of government transparency, arguing that if the JFK files warranted public release, the Epstein files — involving a sex trafficking operation with documented connections to powerful living individuals — warranted the same treatment.

## The 218th Signature and the Vote

On November 12, 2025, Grijalva was sworn in and signed the petition as the 218th name, triggering a mandatory floor vote. The House voted 427-1 on November 18. The Senate passed the bill unanimously the following day. Trump signed it into law on November 19.

Massie later noted the irony: the administration had expended enormous political capital fighting a bill that would ultimately pass with a single opposing vote.

## Reviewing the Files

After the Transparency Act became law, Massie was among the first members of Congress to review the files at the Department of Justice. He and [Ro Khanna](/people/ro-khanna) visited the DOJ together in February 2026 to examine records.

Both members expressed concern that the releases were excessively redacted and that key names had been obscured. They began discussing inherent contempt proceedings against Attorney General [Pam Bondi](/people/pam-bondi) over the DOJ's handling of compliance.

## Significance

Massie's role in the Epstein transparency movement illustrated how a single legislator, working across party lines, could use procedural tools to overcome entrenched institutional resistance. The discharge petition — a mechanism that had succeeded only a handful of times in modern congressional history — became the vehicle that forced the most significant transparency legislation of the decade.
