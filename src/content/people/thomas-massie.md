Thomas Massie is a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Kentucky's 4th congressional district since 2012. Known for his libertarian-leaning politics and independence from party leadership, Massie became a central figure in the push for Epstein file transparency.

## Role in Epstein Transparency

Massie co-authored the Epstein Transparency Act alongside Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), introducing the bipartisan bill in July 2025. The legislation was modeled on the JFK Records Act and required federal agencies to collect and publicly release records related to Jeffrey Epstein.

When the House Judiciary Committee declined to schedule a markup, Massie filed a discharge petition on September 2, 2025 — a rarely successful procedural maneuver requiring 218 signatures to bypass committee leadership and bring the bill directly to the House floor.

Massie's persistent advocacy for the discharge petition, combined with sustained public pressure and bipartisan support, resulted in the petition reaching 218 signatures on November 12, 2025. The bill subsequently passed the House with overwhelming support, moved through the Senate, and was signed into law.

## Political Context

Massie had been one of the earliest members of Congress to publicly call for the release of Epstein-related federal records, viewing it as a matter of government transparency and accountability. His willingness to challenge his own party's leadership through the discharge petition process drew both praise from transparency advocates and criticism from some colleagues who viewed the procedural move as disruptive.
