Pam Bondi serves as U.S. Attorney General and is responsible for the Department of Justice's implementation of the Epstein Transparency Act. Her tenure has been marked by controversy over the DOJ's approach to releasing Epstein-related documents.

The DOJ under Bondi has been accused of excessive redactions in released documents and of tracking which members of Congress access specific files. A photographed document she was carrying revealed internal DOJ procedures for monitoring lawmaker searches of Epstein records.

Bondi has been questioned by the House Judiciary Committee over the growing list of powerful figures connected to Epstein and the department's handling of transparency requirements.
