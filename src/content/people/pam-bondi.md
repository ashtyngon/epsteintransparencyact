Pam Bondi serves as the 87th Attorney General of the United States, nominated by President [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump) and confirmed in February 2025. As head of the Department of Justice, Bondi has been the central government figure in the implementation — and, according to critics, the obstruction — of the Epstein Transparency Act. Her tenure has been defined by contradictory public statements, heavy redactions of released documents, and a February 2026 congressional hearing that became a flashpoint in the transparency fight.

## Background: Florida AG

Before becoming U.S. Attorney General, Bondi served as Florida's Attorney General from 2011 to 2019. Her tenure in Florida overlapped with the period when [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) was a registered sex offender living in Palm Beach. Bondi's office did not pursue additional state charges against Epstein during this time, though the question of whether her office had jurisdiction or cause to act has been disputed.

Bondi was a visible Trump ally throughout her time as Florida AG and became a prominent figure in Trump's legal defense during his first impeachment. Trump nominated her as U.S. Attorney General in late 2024.

## Early Statements on the Epstein Files

In the first months of her tenure, Bondi signaled openness to transparency. In February 2025, during a press event, she stated that a "client list" was "sitting on my desk" — language that implied the DOJ possessed a definitive roster of Epstein's associates. In May 2025, she told reporters there were "tens of thousands of videos" related to the case.

Both claims were later contradicted by the DOJ's own July 7, 2025 memo, which stated that no "client list" existed as a standalone document and that no further releases beyond what had already been provided were warranted. The discrepancy between Bondi's public statements and the DOJ's formal position was never explained.

## The Briefing and the Reversal

In May 2025, Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche briefed Trump that his name appeared in the Epstein files. CNN reported on July 23, 2025 that this briefing preceded the president's shift from supporting transparency to actively opposing it.

After the briefing, the administration's posture changed. The July 7 DOJ memo effectively closed the door on further voluntary releases. Trump began publicly dismissing the files as a "hoax." Bondi's early promises of transparency gave way to a defensive posture focused on limiting disclosure.

## Fighting the Discharge Petition

When Reps. [Thomas Massie](/people/thomas-massie) and [Ro Khanna](/people/ro-khanna) filed a discharge petition to force a floor vote on the Epstein Transparency Act, the White House — with Bondi's participation — mounted an aggressive campaign to prevent it from reaching 218 signatures.

On November 12, 2025, the day the petition was set to succeed, Bondi personally participated in a Situation Room meeting with [Lauren Boebert](/people/lauren-boebert), Deputy AG Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel in a last-ditch effort to convince Boebert to withdraw her signature. Boebert refused.

The White House formally labeled Republican support for the petition "a very hostile act to the administration." [Marjorie Taylor Greene](/people/marjorie-taylor-greene) described receiving "phone call after phone call" pressuring her not to sign. Greene pushed back, saying the true "hostile act" was when Epstein raped women.

## The Transparency Act and Releases

After Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act on November 19, 2025, the DOJ under Bondi was responsible for collecting and releasing records within 30 days. The department missed the December 19 deadline.

The releases that followed were widely criticized. The first batch contained hundreds of pages that were entirely redacted. Within hours, at least 16 files disappeared from the DOJ's Epstein website — including a photograph of Trump with Epstein, Melania Trump, and [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell). After bipartisan backlash, the photo was restored. Deputy AG Blanche called the suggestion that it was removed because of Trump "laughable."

Subsequent releases in late December 2025 and January 2026 brought the total to over 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos. But members of Congress who reviewed the files at the DOJ said the redactions were excessive and that key names and details had been obscured.

## DOJ Surveillance of Lawmakers

A photograph taken during Bondi's February 2026 congressional testimony captured a document she was carrying that detailed DOJ procedures for monitoring which members of Congress accessed specific Epstein files and which search terms they used. The revelation that the DOJ was tracking lawmakers' research into the files — rather than simply facilitating access — drew sharp criticism from both parties.

Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) raised the surveillance issue during the hearing, asking Bondi directly whether the DOJ was tracking congressional searches. Bondi did not directly deny the practice.

## The February 2026 Hearing

On February 13, 2026, Bondi testified before the House Judiciary Committee in a hearing that lasted approximately five hours. The session became one of the most closely watched congressional proceedings of the year.

During the hearing:

- Bondi repeatedly stated the DOJ had complied with the Transparency Act, while members from both parties disputed this, citing extensive redactions and missing files
- She was asked about the "client list on my desk" claim from February 2025. Her responses did not reconcile the earlier statement with the DOJ's July 2025 memo stating no such list existed
- Rep. Moskowitz noted that [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump)'s name appeared more than 38,000 times in the files — "more than Harry Potter in all seven Harry Potter books" — and pressed Bondi on why the DOJ was protecting the president
- Multiple members pointed to the contradiction between Bondi's early transparency rhetoric and the DOJ's subsequent suppression efforts
- Survivors of Epstein's trafficking were present in the hearing room. Bondi did not acknowledge them directly during the hearing, a decision that drew criticism from both victims' advocates and members of Congress
- On February 2, 2026, Deputy AG Blanche had announced there would be no additional prosecutions related to Epstein. Members pressed Bondi on this decision, arguing it was premature given the volume of unreviewd material

## MAGA Backlash

Bondi's handling of the Epstein files contributed to a sustained fracture within Trump's base. Commentators including Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and Alex Jones publicly criticized the administration's approach. Rogan called the reversal on the files "the gaslightiest gaslighting shit I've ever heard in my life." A September 2025 Marist poll found that 90 percent of Americans supported at least partial release of the files.

The backlash was unusual because it came primarily from within the MAGA movement — the same coalition that had propelled Bondi's confirmation. Her position as the public face of the DOJ's Epstein handling made her a focal point for frustration that was, in many cases, directed at the broader administration.

## Current Status

As of February 2026, Bondi remains Attorney General. Reps. Khanna and Massie have discussed pursuing inherent contempt proceedings against her over the DOJ's handling of the file releases. The question of whether the DOJ has fully complied with the Epstein Transparency Act remains actively contested.
