Michael Ferro is a Chicago-based media executive and investor who held leadership positions at some of America's most prominent newspapers. He served as chairman of the Chicago Sun-Times and later became chairman of Tribune Publishing, the parent company of the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the Baltimore Sun, and other major newspapers. Tribune Publishing was briefly renamed Tronc (Tribune Online Content) under his leadership in 2016 before reverting to its original name. Ferro also founded Merrick Ventures, a private investment firm.

## Appearance in the Epstein Files

Emails released under the Epstein Transparency Act showed Ferro in correspondence related to a planned meeting with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). According to the Chicago Tribune's reporting on the documents, Ferro canceled the meeting with Epstein "at the last minute." The correspondence adds Ferro to the list of prominent media figures whose proximity to Epstein — however tangential — is now documented in public records.

The released emails did not detail the purpose of the planned meeting, when it was scheduled, who arranged it, or why Ferro canceled. The fact that a meeting was planned at all indicates Ferro was within the orbit of individuals who facilitated introductions to Epstein, a pattern documented extensively across multiple industries in the released files.

## Significance

Ferro's case is notable for what it illustrates about Epstein's reach into American media. His newspapers controlled editorial coverage across major metropolitan markets. While canceling the meeting suggests Ferro did not follow through on whatever engagement was proposed, the correspondence demonstrates that Epstein's network actively attempted to cultivate relationships with media executives who controlled news coverage and editorial direction.

Ferro's appearance in the files came during the same week that brought other media-related revelations: British broadcaster Piers Morgan was documented 29 times in the files, and podcast host Joe Rogan addressed his own name appearing in the documents.

## Context

The Ferro revelation was reported alongside a wave of disclosures affecting executives across finance, politics, and academia. The January 30, 2026 DOJ release contained approximately 3 million pages of documents, triggering resignations at Goldman Sachs, DP World, and multiple universities. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused some congressional members of naming "completely random people" with no actual Epstein ties during floor speeches, highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing meaningful connections from incidental mentions in a dataset of this scale.

Ferro has not publicly commented on the email correspondence or the nature of the planned meeting with Epstein.
