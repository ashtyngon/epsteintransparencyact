Prince Andrew, Duke of York, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, became one of the most prominent figures linked to [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s trafficking network. His connection to the case — through his longstanding friendship with [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell), his documented visits to Epstein's properties, and the specific allegations made against him by [Virginia Giuffre](/people/virginia-giuffre) — led to a civil lawsuit, a multimillion-pound settlement, the loss of his military titles and royal patronages, and lasting damage to the British monarchy's reputation.

## The Friendship with Epstein and Maxwell

Prince Andrew's connection to Epstein came through Ghislaine Maxwell, whom he had known since at least the 1980s through overlapping British social circles. Maxwell and Andrew were friends before Epstein entered the picture. Through Maxwell, Andrew was introduced to Epstein, and the three socialized together regularly in London, New York, and at Epstein's various properties during the late 1990s and 2000s.

Andrew visited Epstein's Manhattan townhouse on East 71st Street. He was photographed leaving the property in December 2010 — notably, this was after Epstein's 2008 conviction and registration as a sex offender. Andrew also visited Epstein's Palm Beach estate and was a guest at other Epstein-connected properties.

In the 2010 visit to New York, Andrew stayed at Epstein's townhouse for several days. The trip was photographed by tabloid paparazzi, and images of Andrew walking with Epstein in Central Park were published by the Daily Mail, creating the first major wave of public scrutiny.

## Virginia Giuffre's Allegations

Virginia Giuffre (then Virginia Roberts) made specific allegations against Prince Andrew in court filings beginning in 2015. Giuffre alleged that she was directed by Epstein and Maxwell to have sexual encounters with Andrew on three occasions when she was 17 years old:

1. **London, 2001**: At Maxwell's townhouse on Kinnerton Street in Belgravia. Giuffre alleged that she, Andrew, and Maxwell had dinner at a London nightclub (Tramp), after which she was directed to have a sexual encounter with Andrew at Maxwell's residence.

2. **New York**: At Epstein's Manhattan townhouse. Giuffre alleged a second encounter there.

3. **Little St. James, U.S. Virgin Islands**: At Epstein's private island. Giuffre alleged a third encounter on the island, where she described an orgy-like setting.

Andrew has denied all of Giuffre's allegations. Through legal representatives, he stated he has "no recollection" of meeting Giuffre.

## The Photograph

A photograph from approximately 2001 shows Andrew with his arm around Giuffre's bare midriff, with Maxwell standing in the background. The image was taken at Maxwell's London residence. Giuffre has said she was 17 at the time.

Andrew did not deny the photograph's existence during his BBC interview but suggested it may have been fabricated, stating: "I have no recollection of that photograph ever being taken." He later suggested through representatives that he could not be certain it was genuine. No evidence of fabrication has been presented.

The photograph became one of the most widely circulated images in the entire Epstein case.

## The BBC Newsnight Interview (November 16, 2019)

On November 16, 2019, Prince Andrew gave a 49-minute interview to BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis at Buckingham Palace. The interview was widely described as one of the most damaging royal public appearances in modern history.

During the interview, Andrew:

- Denied any sexual contact with Giuffre, saying he had "no recollection of ever meeting this lady."
- Claimed he could not have been at the London nightclub Tramp on the night Giuffre described because he had taken his daughter Princess Beatrice to a party at Pizza Express in Woking — an explanation that was widely mocked.
- Stated that he could not have been sweating at the nightclub, as Giuffre had described, because he suffered from a medical condition — an "overdose of adrenaline" from being shot at during the Falklands War — that prevented him from sweating. He later said this condition had since resolved.
- Described staying at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse in December 2010 — after Epstein's conviction — as a matter of "convenience" and said he went to New York specifically to end the friendship in person, calling it "the honorable thing to do."
- Said his relationship with Epstein had provided "some seriously beneficial outcomes" and characterized Epstein's behavior as "unbecoming."
- Expressed no sympathy for Epstein's victims during the interview.

The interview was widely panned. Commentators noted that Andrew showed no empathy for the victims, offered explanations that strained credulity, and appeared more concerned with defending his own reputation than acknowledging the suffering caused by someone he called a friend.

Within days, Andrew announced he was stepping back from public duties "for the foreseeable future."

## The Civil Lawsuit (2021-2022)

On August 9, 2021, Virginia Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the New York Child Victims Act, which temporarily extended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse claims.

Andrew's legal team attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing that a 2009 settlement agreement between Giuffre and Epstein — which released Epstein and certain "potential defendants" — also protected Andrew. In January 2022, Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected this argument, ruling that Andrew was not specifically named in the 2009 agreement and that the case could proceed to trial and depositions.

On February 15, 2022, a settlement was announced. The financial terms were not officially disclosed, but multiple British and American media outlets reported the figure at approximately 12 million pounds (roughly $15 million at the time). Part of the settlement included a donation to Giuffre's victims' rights charity. Andrew made no admission of guilt or wrongdoing.

The settlement prevented what would have been the unprecedented spectacle of a senior British royal being deposed under oath in a U.S. civil case about sexual abuse allegations connected to Jeffrey Epstein.

## Stripped of Titles and Patronages

On January 13, 2022 — two days after Judge Kaplan's ruling that the civil case could proceed — Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II had stripped Prince Andrew of his honorary military titles and royal patronages. He was also required to stop using the style "His Royal Highness" in any official capacity.

The military titles included Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, honorary Air Commodore of RAF Lossiemouth, and other senior honorary positions. The patronages covered dozens of charitable and civic organizations.

Andrew retained his title as Duke of York and his position in the line of succession to the throne, but he was effectively removed from public-facing royal life. In February 2026, Andrew was stripped of his remaining royal titles — including the Duke of York title — and evicted from his royal residence, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.

## Emails Released Under the Epstein Transparency Act (2026)

Documents released in 2026 under the Epstein Transparency Act included emails between Epstein's associates and staff that referenced Prince Andrew. These communications revealed a pattern of contact that was more extensive and more personal than Andrew had acknowledged in his BBC interview.

The emails showed coordination around Andrew's visits to Epstein's properties, personal correspondence that suggested an ongoing and familiar relationship, and logistical arrangements that contradicted Andrew's claim of a limited, infrequent association.

These revelations renewed calls in the British press and Parliament for Andrew to provide a full accounting of his relationship with Epstein. Andrew, through representatives, has declined to make further public statements.

## Arrest

On Feb. 19, 2026, British police arrested Prince Andrew on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Investigators alleged that Andrew, while serving as a British trade representative, shared confidential government information with Jeffrey Epstein. The arrest marked the first time a member of the British royal family had been taken into custody in connection with the Epstein case. Andrew was questioned and released pending further investigation. No formal charge had been filed as of the date of the arrest.

## What Is and Is Not Established

Prince Andrew was arrested on Feb. 19, 2026, on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He has not been formally charged or convicted of any crime as of that date. The civil lawsuit was settled without admission of guilt. Virginia Giuffre made specific, sworn allegations against Andrew, but the case was never tested at trial or through cross-examination.

What is established is that Andrew maintained a documented, multi-year friendship with a convicted sex offender — a friendship he sustained even after that sex offender's conviction. He visited Epstein's properties, was photographed with an alleged trafficking victim, gave a public interview that raised more questions than it answered, settled a civil case for millions of pounds, was stripped of his royal titles and evicted from his residence, and was arrested in February 2026 on suspicion of sharing confidential information with Epstein.

The Epstein documents continue to illuminate the scope of the relationship. Andrew has offered one extended public account — the Newsnight interview — and the factual record has contradicted significant portions of it.
