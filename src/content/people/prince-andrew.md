Prince Andrew, Duke of York, has been connected to Jeffrey Epstein since the early 2000s. His 2019 BBC Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, in which he denied a close relationship with Epstein and offered widely-questioned explanations, became one of the most scrutinized royal public appearances in modern history.

In 2022, Prince Andrew settled a civil sexual abuse lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum, reportedly in the region of 12 million pounds, without admitting liability.

Newly released Epstein emails in 2026 have further contradicted his Newsnight claims, showing extensive personal correspondence that undercuts his assertion that the relationship was limited and infrequent.
