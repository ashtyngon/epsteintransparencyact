Peter Mandelson, Baron Mandelson, is a British Labour politician who has held some of the most senior positions in UK and European governance. He served as Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills under Prime Minister Gordon Brown, as European Commissioner for Trade (2004-2008), and as a member of the House of Lords. Most recently, he served as the United Kingdom's Ambassador to the United States until early 2026.

## Connection to Epstein

Mandelson's name appeared repeatedly in documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act. His documented relationship with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) spans years and multiple continents, though the full scope of their interactions remains unclear from publicly available materials. Reports have linked Mandelson to visits at Epstein properties, including his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Mandelson's connections to Epstein placed him within the same social network as [Prince Andrew](/people/prince-andrew), whose own Epstein ties have been extensively documented. The intersection of British political and royal circles in Epstein's network has drawn particular scrutiny.

## Congressional Subpoena

On February 13, 2026, Representatives Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.) formally requested Mandelson testify before Congress regarding his Epstein relationship. Their letter stated it was "clear" that the former ambassador "holds critical information" about Epstein's network.

The summons made Mandelson the first foreign ambassador — current or former — called to answer questions about Epstein connections before Congress. The request created potential diplomatic friction between Washington and London, as no sitting or former British ambassador had previously been called before Congress for questioning related to personal conduct.

## Jurisdictional Challenge

Congress lacks the legal power to compel testimony from foreign nationals on foreign soil. The subpoena tests whether international pressure and public scrutiny can achieve what legal authority alone cannot. The UK government has not indicated whether it will encourage Mandelson to cooperate or attempt to shield him from testimony.

Whether Mandelson will appear before the committee has not been confirmed. A hearing date has not been announced. His cooperation or resistance is expected to set a precedent for how international figures respond to American congressional subpoenas in cases with global reach.

## Context

Mandelson's summons came amid a broader congressional investigation that also subpoenaed billionaire Les Wexner, pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi over document redactions, and prompted multiple executive resignations across industries. His case illustrates the international dimension of the Epstein investigation and the challenges of pursuing accountability across national borders.
