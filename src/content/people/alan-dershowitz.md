Alan Dershowitz is a prominent defense attorney and Harvard Law professor emeritus who became deeply intertwined with the Epstein case in multiple roles — as Epstein's defense lawyer, as a named individual in civil allegations, and as a public commentator on the case.

## Legal Representation

Dershowitz was part of Jeffrey Epstein's legal defense team during the 2007-2008 plea deal negotiations that resulted in the controversial non-prosecution agreement with then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta. He also represented Epstein in other legal matters.

## Accusations

In 2014, Virginia Giuffre (then Virginia Roberts) named Dershowitz in court filings, alleging that Epstein and Maxwell directed her to have sexual encounters with Dershowitz while she was underage. Dershowitz has categorically and repeatedly denied these allegations, calling them "totally false and made up."

Dershowitz and Giuffre engaged in mutual defamation lawsuits. In 2024, a settlement was reached in which Giuffre's attorneys acknowledged that her allegations against Dershowitz may have been "mistaken." Dershowitz characterized this as a vindication.

## Public Commentary

Throughout the Epstein saga, Dershowitz has been one of the most vocal public commentators, appearing frequently on television to discuss the case, defend his own conduct, and critique the legal proceedings against Epstein and Maxwell. His dual role as both a participant in the case and a legal analyst commenting on it has drawn criticism.

## Released Documents

Dershowitz's name has appeared extensively in documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act and in previously unsealed civil court records. He has maintained that any contacts with Epstein were professional and social in nature, and that he never engaged in any illegal activity.
