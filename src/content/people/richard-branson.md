Sir Richard Branson is a British billionaire, the founder of the Virgin Group conglomerate, and the owner of Necker Island, a private island in the British Virgin Islands. Branson became connected to the Epstein story through [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s visits to Necker Island and through newly released documents showing that Epstein used institutional prestige to cultivate the relationship.

## Background

Born in 1950 in London, Branson founded Virgin Records in 1972 and built the Virgin brand into a global conglomerate spanning airlines, telecommunications, banking, health care, and space travel. He was knighted in 2000 for services to entrepreneurship. Forbes has estimated his net worth at approximately $3 billion. He has lived on Necker Island, which he purchased in 1978 for $180,000 and developed into a luxury retreat, since the early 1980s.

## Epstein's Visits to Necker Island

Epstein visited Branson's Necker Island, which is located approximately 100 miles from Epstein's own private island, Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The proximity of the two islands in the Caribbean has drawn attention in the context of Epstein's network in the region. Branson confirmed in 2019 that Epstein had visited Necker Island, stating that Epstein had come as a guest and that he was not aware of Epstein's criminal activities.

The timing and number of Epstein's visits to Necker Island have not been comprehensively disclosed. Branson has said that he did not maintain a close relationship with Epstein and that interactions were limited.

## Nobel Prize Connection in Released Files

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act, signed November 19, 2025, revealed that Epstein used his connection to Thorbjorn Jagland — former Norwegian prime minister and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee — in outreach to Branson. Epstein name-dropped Jagland in invitations and messages to Branson, using the Nobel connection as a prestige tool to attract and maintain relationships with high-profile figures.

The files showed a pattern in Epstein's approach: he would host Jagland, then leverage that relationship in subsequent communications with business leaders and other contacts, including Branson, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon.

## Public Response

Branson addressed the Epstein connection in 2019, stating that he had met Epstein on a small number of occasions and that Epstein had visited Necker Island. He said he found the allegations against Epstein "abhorrent" and that he had no knowledge of criminal activity. The Virgin Group has not issued further statements in response to the 2026 document releases.

## Significance

Branson's appearance in the Epstein files illustrates Epstein's strategy of cultivating relationships with global business figures by offering access to prestigious institutions and individuals. The Nobel committee connection, in particular, demonstrates the transactional nature of Epstein's networking — using one high-status relationship to attract another. Branson's ownership of a private Caribbean island near Epstein's own island has made his case a recurring subject of public attention in the broader Epstein investigation.
