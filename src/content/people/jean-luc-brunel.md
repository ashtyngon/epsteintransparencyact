Jean-Luc Brunel was a French modeling agent and one of Jeffrey Epstein's closest associates. His modeling agencies, including MC2 Model Management, were accused of serving as pipelines for recruiting young women and girls for Epstein.

## Connections to Epstein

Brunel operated in the fashion and modeling world for decades. Multiple accusers alleged that Brunel used his position as a modeling scout to recruit vulnerable young women under the pretense of offering them careers, only to deliver them to Epstein. Brunel had access to Epstein's properties and appeared in flight logs.

Epstein reportedly provided financial backing for MC2 Model Management, Brunel's Miami-based agency, blurring the lines between legitimate modeling recruitment and trafficking.

## Criminal Charges

In December 2020, French authorities arrested Brunel at Charles de Gaulle Airport as he attempted to board a flight. He was charged with rape of minors and sexual harassment, with allegations spanning decades. French prosecutors also investigated him for sex trafficking in connection with Epstein.

## Death

On February 19, 2022, Brunel was found dead in his cell at La Santé prison in Paris. French authorities ruled his death a suicide by hanging. The circumstances drew immediate comparisons to Epstein's death in August 2019, and victims' advocates expressed frustration that another key figure had died before facing trial.

His death further limited the possibility of a full accounting of the Epstein network's operations, particularly its international dimension.
