Leslie H. Wexner is a billionaire retail executive and the founder of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. His relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has drawn intense scrutiny following the release of documents under the Epstein Transparency Act.

Wexner gave Epstein sweeping power of attorney over his finances and transferred ownership of a Manhattan townhouse to Epstein that later became a hub for abuse. Wexner has stated that Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money" from him and that he severed ties in 2007.

In February 2026, a congressman publicly labeled Wexner a "co-conspirator" in Epstein's trafficking operation based on documents reviewed at the Department of Justice. Congress has sought to depose Wexner about the extent of his knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities.
