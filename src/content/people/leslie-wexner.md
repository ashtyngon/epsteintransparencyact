Leslie H. Wexner is the founder and former CEO of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, and other retail brands. He is one of the wealthiest people in Ohio and built a retail empire that at its peak was valued at tens of billions of dollars. He is also [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s only confirmed financial management client — and the person whose wealth, access, and trust provided the financial foundation on which Epstein built his operation.

The relationship between Wexner and Epstein is one of the least explained and most consequential connections in the entire case. The degree of control Wexner ceded to Epstein — sweeping power of attorney, a $77 million Manhattan mansion transferred for nothing, access to the Victoria's Secret brand — has no parallel in the documented relationships between Epstein and other wealthy individuals.

## How They Connected

Wexner and Epstein became close in the late 1980s. The exact circumstances of their introduction are disputed. One account places it through Robert Meister, an insurance executive. Another, described by author James Patterson in "Filthy Rich," suggests they were connected through social circles in New York and Columbus, Ohio.

By 1991, the relationship was firmly established. Epstein was managing Wexner's finances and had been granted power of attorney over Wexner's affairs — an extraordinary grant of authority that gave Epstein the legal power to sign documents, conduct transactions, and make financial decisions on Wexner's behalf.

Wexner's associates and L Brands executives have described Epstein's role in terms that ranged from financial advisor to something closer to a shadow manager of Wexner's personal affairs. Epstein attended L Brands board-adjacent functions, had access to Wexner's Columbus estate, and traveled on Wexner's behalf.

## The Power of Attorney

The scope of the power of attorney Wexner granted Epstein is one of the most striking facts in the case. It was not a narrow financial advisory arrangement. According to reporting by the New York Times, Epstein had the authority to hire people, sign checks, manage properties, and execute financial transactions in Wexner's name.

Wexner has not publicly disclosed when the power of attorney was first granted, when or whether it was revoked, or the full scope of transactions Epstein executed under its authority. Legal experts quoted in reporting about the case described the arrangement as highly unusual — the kind of authority typically reserved for a family member or the most trusted personal representative, not an outside financial advisor.

The power of attorney meant that Epstein had, for a period of years, largely unchecked access to a billionaire's resources. How he used that access — and whether Wexner was aware of or indifferent to how it was being used — remains a central unresolved question.

## The Manhattan Mansion Transfer

In 1989, Wexner purchased the townhouse at 9 East 71st Street on Manhattan's Upper East Side for approximately $13.2 million. He spent millions more renovating the property into what became the largest single-family residence in New York City — a seven-story, approximately 21,000-square-foot mansion with more than 40 rooms.

In 1998, the property was transferred from a Wexner-linked entity to Epstein for $0. The mechanism was a transfer through the Wexner Family Limited Partnership, with no sale price recorded. The property's market value at the time of transfer was estimated at $77 million.

The townhouse became a primary location for Epstein's abuse. Multiple victims described being assaulted at the property. When the FBI raided the mansion in July 2019, agents recovered a safe containing CDs labeled with names and dates — suggesting possible blackmail material — along with diamonds, cash, and a fake passport.

Wexner has never provided a detailed public explanation of why the property was transferred for $0, what consideration (if any) he received, or why he did not raise public concerns when the property became associated with criminal conduct.

## The Victoria's Secret Connection

Multiple accounts — from models, former employees, and reporting by the New York Times and other outlets — describe Epstein leveraging his association with Wexner and Victoria's Secret to recruit young women.

Epstein told women he could get them auditions or jobs with Victoria's Secret. Alicia Arden, a model, filed a police report in 1997 (before Epstein's eventual arrest) describing an encounter with Epstein in a Santa Monica hotel room where he posed as a Victoria's Secret talent scout before sexually assaulting her.

Other women have described similar approaches. Epstein's connection to Wexner — and by extension to Victoria's Secret, one of the most recognized brands in fashion — gave him a powerful recruitment tool. The promise of a modeling career or an introduction to the Victoria's Secret world was, for young women in the fashion industry, a significant lure.

Wexner has said he was unaware of Epstein using the Victoria's Secret name in this way. L Brands has stated that Epstein was never formally affiliated with Victoria's Secret in any official capacity, though his informal access to the brand through Wexner is well documented.

## Wexner's 2019 Letter

On August 7, 2019 — three days before Epstein's death — Wexner sent a letter to the Wexner Foundation community. In the letter, he stated that Epstein had "misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family." Wexner said he had discovered the misappropriation and severed ties with Epstein "in 2007" — a year after the Palm Beach police investigation became public and approximately a year before Epstein's plea deal.

The letter did not specify the amounts misappropriated, the nature of the misappropriation, or whether Wexner had reported it to law enforcement. Wexner said he was "NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment" and expressed "disgust" at the allegations.

The 2007 date for the severance of ties has drawn scrutiny. If Wexner ended the relationship in 2007, it means the friendship and financial arrangement continued for approximately 15 to 18 years — spanning a period during which Epstein was operating his trafficking network.

## Financial Questions

The source of Epstein's apparent wealth has never been satisfactorily explained, and Wexner is at the center of that mystery. Epstein claimed to manage money exclusively for billionaires, but no other client besides Wexner has ever been identified or confirmed.

Multiple financial analyses — by Bloomberg, the New York Times, and others — have noted that Epstein's lifestyle (multiple residences valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, a fleet of aircraft, household staff) did not appear to be supported by any identifiable business operations or income stream beyond the Wexner relationship.

The question of whether Epstein's wealth came entirely from Wexner — through authorized compensation, unauthorized misappropriation, or some combination — has not been resolved. No independent audit of the Epstein-Wexner financial relationship has been conducted or made public.

Epstein's estate, upon his death, was valued at approximately $634 million. Wexner's claimed misappropriation, if accurate, would account for a substantial portion of that figure — but the specific amounts, timing, and mechanisms remain undisclosed.

## The February 2026 Congressional Subpoena

In February 2026, following the release of documents under the Epstein Transparency Act, a congressman reviewing files at the Department of Justice publicly labeled Wexner a "co-conspirator" in Epstein's trafficking operation. The characterization was based on documents the congressman viewed at the DOJ.

Congress subsequently issued a subpoena seeking Wexner's testimony about the extent of his knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities, the financial relationship between the two men, and the circumstances surrounding the mansion transfer and power of attorney.

As of February 2026, Wexner has not publicly responded to the subpoena or the co-conspirator characterization. His legal representatives have not issued a public statement on the congressional action.

## What Is and Is Not Established

Wexner has never been charged with any crime. He has denied knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities. He characterized himself as a victim of Epstein's financial misappropriation.

What is established is that Wexner gave Epstein extraordinary control over his finances — more control than any other known relationship in Epstein's network. He transferred a $77 million property for nothing. That property became a site of systematic abuse. The Victoria's Secret brand he built was used as a recruiting tool for trafficking victims. The financial relationship lasted at least 15 years, spanning the period when Epstein was operating his trafficking network.

Wexner has claimed he was unaware of the abuse, unaware of the misuse of his brand, and a victim of financial misappropriation. Congress has subpoenaed him to explain how all of that was possible. The question is not whether Wexner was formally involved in the trafficking — there is no evidence of that. The question is how a billionaire who granted another person total control over his finances, his property, and his most valuable brand failed to detect or prevent the abuse that was conducted using those assets.
