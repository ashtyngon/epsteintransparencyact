Ghislaine Maxwell is a British socialite and convicted sex offender. In December 2021, she was found guilty of five of six counts related to her role in recruiting and grooming minors for Jeffrey Epstein.

In June 2022, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. She was convicted of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and transporting a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, among other charges.

Maxwell's trial brought significant public attention to the extent of Epstein's network and the role of associates in facilitating his crimes.
