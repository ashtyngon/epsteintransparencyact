Naomi Campbell is a British supermodel and founder of Fashion for Relief, a charitable organization established in 2005. DOJ emails released in February 2026 documented years of correspondence between Campbell and [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein), revealing a relationship more extensive than her prior public statements suggested.

## DOJ Email Revelations

The New York Times reported in February 2026 that [released DOJ emails](/news/2026-02-15-naomi-campbell-s-epstein-ties-exposed-in-released-files) showed correspondence between Campbell and Epstein spanning from 2002 to 2010, with multiple exchanges per year after 2005.

The emails documented:
- Coordination of flights on Epstein's private aircraft
- Meetings at Epstein's properties in Manhattan and the U.S. Virgin Islands
- Social invitations including dinners at Epstein's townhouse
- Epstein introducing Campbell to potential donors for her charity work in Africa

One email chain coordinated Campbell's travel schedule with Epstein's assistant, discussing pickup times and locations.

## Contact After Conviction

The email timestamps show correspondence continued after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Epstein served 18 months and was released on work-release terms. The documented post-conviction contact contradicted the impression left by Campbell's 2020 public statement.

## Campbell's Public Statements

In 2020, Campbell told media that Epstein was "an acquaintance" she met "more than 15 years ago" through the fashion industry. She said she was "not aware of his illegal activity."

After the 2026 email release, Campbell [denied involvement in Epstein's criminal activities](/news/2026-02-18-supermodel-naomi-campbell-stayed-in-epstein-s-orbit-but-denies-ties-with-his-ill) while acknowledging social connections. Her representatives did not respond to New York Times requests for comment about the emails.

## What Is Established

Campbell has not been accused of any criminal conduct. The emails contain no allegations of illegal activity by her. What is documented is that the scope and duration of contact between Campbell and Epstein — coordinated flights, property visits, regular correspondence over eight years including post-conviction — was more extensive than the "acquaintance" characterization she offered publicly.
