Donald Trump's connections to Jeffrey Epstein span decades, and his shifting positions on the Epstein files became one of the defining political stories of 2025.

## Early Connections

Trump and Epstein were social acquaintances in the 1990s and early 2000s in Palm Beach and New York. In a 2002 New York Magazine profile, Trump described Epstein as "a lot of fun to be with" and noted that Epstein "likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." Trump later said he had a "falling out" with Epstein and banned him from Mar-a-Lago, though the timeline and reasons remain disputed.

Trump appeared in Epstein's contacts, and Epstein was a member of Mar-a-Lago. Flight logs show Trump took at least one flight on Epstein's aircraft, though not to Epstein's private island.

## Campaign Promise (2024)

During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly pledged to release the Epstein files. In June 2024 on Fox & Friends, he said he would "take a look" at releasing files. In September 2024 on the Lex Fridman podcast, he committed more directly. Running mate JD Vance reinforced the promise on the Theo Von podcast.

## Reversal (2025)

After AG Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche briefed Trump in May 2025 that his name appeared in the files, Trump's stance shifted dramatically. In July 2025, he called the files "boring," declared them "a big hoax," and attacked his own supporters who demanded transparency as "weaklings."

## Signing the Act

Despite months of opposition, Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act on November 19, 2025, after it passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously. He attempted to reframe the signing as consistent with his original promise.
