Nadia Marcinkova was brought to the United States from the former Yugoslavia by [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) when she was a teenager. According to court filings and victim statements cited in reporting by the Miami Herald and other outlets, Epstein reportedly acquired her from her family.

## Role in Epstein's Operation

Multiple victims described Marcinkova's involvement in sexual abuse in sworn depositions taken as part of civil litigation. According to court filings:

- Victims stated Marcinkova participated in sexual encounters with Epstein and underage girls
- She was described in police reports as being present during abuse at Epstein's Palm Beach residence
- The Palm Beach Police Department investigation identified her as a person of interest

Marcinkova's own status — brought to the U.S. as a minor by Epstein — has been described by legal commentators as reflecting a dual role: both a potential victim of trafficking and an alleged participant in abuse of others.

## The 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement

Marcinkova was one of four named potential co-conspirators who received immunity under the 2008 federal plea deal negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta. The blanket immunity prevented federal prosecution for any crimes related to Epstein's trafficking operation.

## Later Life

Marcinkova later changed her name to Nadia Marcinko and obtained a commercial pilot license. She founded a charter aviation company and marketed herself as "Global Girl," building a social media presence around aviation. She has not made substantive public statements about her history with Epstein.

## What Is Established

Marcinkova was named as a potential co-conspirator by federal prosecutors. Victim statements describe her participation in abuse. She was brought to the U.S. by Epstein as a minor. She received immunity under the 2008 deal and has never been charged. The question of whether she was primarily a victim or a facilitator — or both — has never been resolved in court.
