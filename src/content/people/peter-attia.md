Dr. Peter Attia is a physician known for his focus on longevity medicine and preventive health. He trained in general surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital and later became affiliated with the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. He gained a large public following through his podcast, "The Drive," which covers topics including longevity, nutrition, and performance medicine. In addition to his medical practice, he held the position of chief science officer at David, a company focused on high-protein nutrition products.

## Contact with Epstein

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act revealed that Attia spent part of the 2010s in frequent contact with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). The correspondence and visits spanned several years and included exchanges in which Attia provided medical advice to Epstein. The released documents also included crude emails about women exchanged between Attia and Epstein, the content of which drew public attention following their release.

The period of close contact documented in the files overlapped with years after Epstein's 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting a minor — a conviction that required Epstein to register as a sex offender. The contacts indicated Attia maintained the relationship through a significant portion of Epstein's post-conviction years.

## Resignation from David

Following the release of the correspondence, Attia stepped down from his position as chief science officer at David on February 3, 2026. The company did not provide extensive public comment on the departure. Attia did not immediately offer a detailed public statement about the nature of his relationship with Epstein or the substance of the released documents.

## Public Profile

Attia had built a substantial reputation in the health and longevity space in the years prior to the disclosure, including publishing a widely-read book on longevity medicine. His case was notable in that his professional reputation rested substantially on questions of scientific rigor and personal integrity — values that his documented association with Epstein placed under scrutiny. He remains a licensed physician.
