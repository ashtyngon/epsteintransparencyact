Dan Ariely is a behavioral economist and professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. He is widely known for his research on human decision-making, irrational behavior, and dishonesty — subjects he explored in a series of bestselling books including "Predictably Irrational" and "The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty." His public profile made him one of the more recognized academic figures in the popular science space, with TED talks, media appearances, and a large general readership.

## Contact with Epstein

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act revealed that Ariely sought out [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) in connection with his research. The correspondence between the two was extensive, and reporting on the released files suggested the relationship was not limited to a strictly professional research exchange. The nature of the personal dimensions of their contact was not fully detailed in reporting available at the time of the initial disclosures.

Ariely's self-initiated contact with Epstein placed his case in a distinct category from figures who received outreach from Epstein or were introduced to him through intermediaries. The documents indicated that Ariely approached Epstein, making the relationship one in which a prominent academic researcher pursued access to a convicted sex offender.

## Irony of Subject Matter

Ariely's professional focus on the psychology of dishonesty and the mechanisms by which people deceive themselves and others added a dimension of public commentary to the disclosures. His research examines how intelligent individuals rationalize unethical conduct — a body of work that observers noted was in tension with his documented sustained contact with Epstein following the latter's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor.

As of February 21, 2026, Ariely remained a professor at Duke University. No institutional action had been publicly announced by Duke at the time the disclosures became public. His case was among the final entries added to the New York Times's running tracker of Epstein-related fallout.
