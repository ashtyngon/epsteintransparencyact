Steve Bannon is a political strategist, media executive, and commentator who served as White House chief strategist under President [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump) from January to August 2017. He previously served as executive chairman of Breitbart News (2012-2018) and was a key figure in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Bannon's name appeared in Epstein files released in 2026, in the context of outreach from [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein).

## Background

Born in 1953 in Norfolk, Virginia, Bannon served in the U.S. Navy, attended Harvard Business School, and worked at Goldman Sachs before entering media and politics. He became executive chairman of Breitbart News in 2012 following the death of founder Andrew Breitbart. He joined the Trump presidential campaign as chief executive in August 2016 and was appointed White House chief strategist in January 2017. He left the White House in August 2017.

In August 2020, Bannon was arrested on fraud charges related to the "We Build the Wall" crowdfunding campaign. He was pardoned by President Trump on January 20, 2021. In a separate case, he was convicted in July 2022 of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House January 6th Committee and served a four-month sentence at a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, beginning in October 2024.

## Appearance in Epstein Files

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law on November 19, 2025, show that Epstein contacted Bannon as part of a broader pattern of outreach to politically connected individuals. Specifically, Epstein name-dropped Thorbjorn Jagland — former Norwegian prime minister and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee — in communications directed at Bannon, using the Nobel connection as a prestige tool.

The files show Epstein used this same strategy with multiple high-profile targets simultaneously, including Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. Epstein would host Jagland, then reference those meetings when reaching out to other contacts. Bannon was among the political figures targeted through this method.

## Role in Epstein Files Discourse

Bannon has been a prominent voice in the broader political conversation around the Epstein files, using his "War Room" podcast and media appearances to call for full disclosure of Epstein's associates. He has framed the Epstein case as emblematic of elite corruption and has pushed for the release of unredacted documents. His commentary has positioned the Epstein files as a populist issue, arguing that powerful figures are being protected from accountability.

## Context

Bannon's appearance in the Epstein files places him in the category of political figures who were contacted by Epstein as part of his network-building efforts. The released communications do not indicate a deep personal relationship between Bannon and Epstein, but rather that Bannon was among the prominent figures Epstein attempted to draw into his orbit using institutional prestige as bait. Bannon's dual role — as someone named in the files and as a commentator demanding full transparency — has made him a distinctive figure in the ongoing Epstein discourse.
