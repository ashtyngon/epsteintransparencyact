Steve Bannon is a political strategist, media executive, and commentator who served as White House chief strategist under President [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump) from January to August 2017. He previously served as executive chairman of Breitbart News (2012–2018) and was a key figure in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. DOJ files released in January 2026 revealed a far deeper personal relationship between Bannon and [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) than previously known — including a joint scheme to produce a documentary designed to "take down" Pope Francis.

## Background

Born in 1953 in Norfolk, Virginia, Bannon served in the U.S. Navy, attended Harvard Business School, and worked at Goldman Sachs before entering media and politics. He became executive chairman of Breitbart News in 2012 following the death of founder Andrew Breitbart. He joined the Trump presidential campaign as chief executive in August 2016 and was appointed White House chief strategist in January 2017. He left the White House in August 2017.

In August 2020, Bannon was arrested on fraud charges related to the "We Build the Wall" crowdfunding campaign. He was pardoned by President Trump on January 20, 2021. In a separate case, he was convicted in July 2022 of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House January 6th Committee and served a four-month sentence at a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, beginning in October 2024.

## The Bannon-Epstein Communications

Text messages and emails between Bannon and Epstein from 2018 and 2019 were discovered in the 3.5 million pages of documents released by the DOJ on January 30, 2026. The communications were first reported by the Substack newsletter "Letters from Leo" and subsequently covered by CNN, The Daily Beast, and Religion News Service.

The exchanges reveal a relationship that was personal, strategic, and ongoing well after Epstein's 2008 conviction — contradicting any suggestion that Bannon was merely a passive recipient of Epstein's outreach.

### 2018: Shared Grievances

Earlier correspondence from 2018 shows Bannon and Epstein lamenting the Vatican's stance against xenophobia, racism, and populism, as well as the Holy See's diplomatic relationship with China. Bannon had long viewed Pope Francis as an obstacle to his vision of nationalist populism in Europe. In a 2018 interview with The Spectator, Bannon called Pope Francis "beneath contempt."

### April 2019: The Pope Francis Plot Begins

On April 1, 2019, Epstein sent Bannon an article titled "Pope Francis or Steve Bannon? Catholics must choose." Bannon replied: "easy choice."

Around the same time, Bannon conceived a plan to adapt Frederic Martel's book "In the Closet of the Vatican" — which claimed that approximately 80 percent of clergy working in the Vatican are gay — into a documentary film. Bannon met Martel in Paris at the Hotel Le Bristol to discuss film rights. Martel told CNN he declined, saying his French publisher controlled the rights, and that he believed Bannon wanted to "instrumentalize" his book.

### June 2019: "Will Take Down Francis"

In June 2019 — weeks before Epstein's July 6 arrest — Bannon messaged Epstein about the proposed documentary: "Will take down Francis." He added: "The Clintons, Xi, Francis, EU — come on brother."

Bannon told Epstein: "You are now exec producer of 'ITCOTV'" — an abbreviation of "In the Closet of the Vatican." Epstein responded with a single word: "Porn."

In another exchange, Epstein wrote to Bannon: "Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven."

### Cardinal Burke's Break

U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke learned of Bannon's interest in the Martel film and cut ties with the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, a conservative Catholic organization he felt had become too closely identified with Bannon. In a June 25, 2019 letter, Burke wrote: "I am not at all of the mind that the book should be made into a film."

## Nobel Committee Connection

Separately, the files show Epstein used [Thorbjorn Jagland](/people/thorbjorn-jagland) — former Norwegian prime minister and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee — as a prestige tool in outreach to Bannon. Epstein name-dropped Jagland when contacting Bannon, employing the same strategy he used with [Richard Branson](/people/richard-branson) and [Lawrence Summers](/people/lawrence-summers).

## Role in Epstein Files Discourse

Bannon has been a prominent voice in the broader political conversation around the Epstein files, using his "War Room" podcast and media appearances to call for full disclosure of Epstein's associates. He has framed the Epstein case as emblematic of elite corruption and pushed for the release of unredacted documents. His commentary has positioned the Epstein files as a populist issue, arguing that powerful figures are being protected from accountability.

As of February 15, 2026, Bannon has not publicly responded to the revelations about his communications with Epstein or the Pope Francis documentary scheme. CNN and The Daily Beast both reported contacting Bannon's representatives for comment without receiving a response.

## What Is Established

The released files show that Bannon maintained a personal, communicative relationship with Epstein through at least June 2019 — three weeks before Epstein's arrest. The communications included strategic planning for a media project designed to damage Pope Francis, with Epstein designated as the project's executive producer. Bannon's position as both a named figure in the Epstein files and a public advocate for their release has created a significant credibility problem, particularly given his silence about his own documented communications with Epstein.
