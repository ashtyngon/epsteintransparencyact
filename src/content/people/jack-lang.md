Jack Lang is a French socialist politician who served twice as France's Minister of Culture — under President François Mitterrand from 1981 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1993 — and later as Minister of Education. He is credited with expanding France's cultural budget and championing policies that shaped French cultural identity over two decades. In more recent years, he served as president of the Institut du Monde Arabe, the Arab World Institute, a prominent cultural institution in Paris dedicated to promoting dialogue between the Arab world and France.

## Resignation from the Arab World Institute

On February 7, 2026, Lang announced he would resign as head of the Arab World Institute after French authorities disclosed they were investigating reports of financial links between Lang, his family, and [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). The nature and extent of those financial connections were not fully detailed in public reporting, but the announcement of an investigation by French authorities was sufficient to prompt Lang's departure from the institution.

## French Investigation

French authorities confirmed they were examining the financial relationship between Lang, his family members, and Epstein. The investigation placed Lang among a growing number of European public figures facing legal scrutiny — rather than mere reputational damage — as a result of the Epstein file releases. The French inquiry was separate from proceedings underway in Norway involving [Terje Rød-Larsen](/people/terje-rod-larsen) and [Mona Juul](/people/mona-juul).

## Context

Lang's case added to a pattern of fallout affecting prominent European cultural and political figures named in the Epstein documents. The Arab World Institute, which receives funding from both the French government and Arab states, is among France's most visible diplomatic-cultural institutions. Lang's resignation removed from leadership a figure whose personal reputation had become entangled with the Epstein disclosures at a moment of heightened international scrutiny of those named in the released files.
