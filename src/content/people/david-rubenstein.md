David Rubenstein is the co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, and the controlling owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team. His name appeared in documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act in early 2026, with records indicating contact with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) dating to at least 2010.

## Background

Rubenstein co-founded the Carlyle Group in 1987. The firm manages over $400 billion in assets and is one of the most prominent private equity operations in the world, with investments spanning defense, aerospace, energy, healthcare, and technology. Rubenstein has been one of the most visible figures in American finance and philanthropy, serving on the boards of numerous institutions including the Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, and the Council on Foreign Relations.

In 2024, Rubenstein led a group that purchased the Baltimore Orioles for a reported $1.725 billion.

## Appearance in the Epstein Files

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act in February 2026 included records showing Rubenstein's name in connection with Epstein. The records indicated scheduled meetings and communications between the two men, with the earliest documented contact dating to approximately 2010.

The nature and extent of their relationship — whether it was limited to social or financial circles common among billionaires in New York and Washington, or involved deeper entanglement — has not been fully established by the released documents.

## Public Response

As of February 2026, Rubenstein has not made a detailed public statement addressing the specific contents of the Epstein documents bearing his name. The Carlyle Group has not issued a formal response.

## Context

Rubenstein's appearance in the files placed him among a growing number of prominent business and political figures whose names surfaced in the document releases. His case illustrates the breadth of Epstein's network across finance, philanthropy, and institutional power — and the ongoing questions about what the connections documented in these files represent.
