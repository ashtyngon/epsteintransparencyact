David Rubenstein is the co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, and the owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team. His name appeared in recently released Epstein documents, with records indicating meetings with Epstein dating to at least 2012.

Rubenstein purchased the Baltimore Orioles in 2024 for a reported $1.725 billion. His connection to Epstein has raised questions about the extent of their relationship and whether it involved financial entanglements beyond social meetings.
