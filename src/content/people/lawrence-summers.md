Lawrence Summers is an American economist who has held some of the most powerful positions in U.S. economic policy and higher education. He served as the 71st U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President [Bill Clinton](/people/bill-clinton) from 1999 to 2001, as the 27th President of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006, and as Director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2010. He is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard, the university's highest academic distinction.

## Harvard and Epstein

Summers' tenure as Harvard president (2001-2006) overlapped with a period when [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) donated $9.1 million to the university, funding the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics run by evolutionary biologist Martin Nowak. The donations were made between 1998 and 2008. Epstein visited Harvard's campus at least 40 times after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor, meeting with faculty including Summers and Nowak.

The meetings between Summers and Epstein after the 2008 conviction have drawn particular scrutiny. By that point, Epstein was a registered sex offender, and his criminal conduct was a matter of public record. Summers continued contact with Epstein during a period when other prominent individuals also maintained relationships with the convicted financier despite his status.

Harvard conducted an internal review in 2020 that acknowledged Epstein's campus visits but did not discipline any faculty. Critics called the review insufficient.

## Named in Epstein's Outreach

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act in February 2026 revealed that Epstein used his connection to Summers as a networking tool. Files show Epstein name-dropped Summers — alongside former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel Committee — in outreach to Richard Branson, Steve Bannon, and other elite figures.

Summers appeared in communications where Epstein promoted his connections to the Nobel Committee and to major academic institutions. The communications show Epstein systematically leveraging prestigious relationships to recruit new contacts into his network. Summers' Harvard tenure and Treasury Department background made him a particularly valuable name for Epstein to reference.

## Broader Academic Context

Summers' involvement is part of a larger pattern of Epstein's infiltration of elite academic institutions. At MIT, the relationship led to the resignation of Media Lab director Joi Ito in September 2019 after investigative reporting revealed Epstein had donated $850,000 and that Ito had concealed the relationship. MIT professor Seth Lloyd received a $225,000 personal research grant from Epstein. At Ohio State University, Epstein's only confirmed financial client Les Wexner is the institution's largest donor.

Epstein's university relationships followed a consistent pattern: donations purchased access to faculty, campus visits provided legitimacy, and those connections were then marketed to other elites as proof of intellectual credibility.

## Public Response

Summers has addressed the Epstein relationship in limited public statements, acknowledging meetings but characterizing them as part of normal academic and intellectual engagement. He has not provided a detailed public accounting of the frequency, duration, or substance of his interactions with Epstein after the 2008 conviction. The full scope of their relationship remains a subject of ongoing reporting and investigation.
