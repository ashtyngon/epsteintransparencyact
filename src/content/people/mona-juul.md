Mona Juul is a Norwegian diplomat who had built a career spanning decades in Norwegian foreign service, including postings to the Middle East. She is married to [Terje Rød-Larsen](/people/terje-rod-larsen), a prominent Norwegian diplomat who served as president and chief executive of the International Peace Institute.

## Suspension and Resignation

Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs suspended Juul as Norway's ambassador to Jordan and Iraq in early February 2026, following public disclosures of financial dealings between her, her husband, and [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). The suspension came after newly unsealed documents revealed the extent of the financial connections between the couple and Epstein, which had not been previously disclosed in full.

On February 8, 2026, Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Juul's resignation, which came days after her suspension. The ministry's statement offered no further details beyond confirming the resignation and suspension had taken place.

## Corruption Investigation

Norwegian police launched a corruption investigation into both Juul and her husband, Terje Rød-Larsen, as of February 8, 2026. The investigation relates to the financial dealings between the couple and Epstein. Among the details that drew scrutiny was the revelation that Juul and Rød-Larsen had been left $10 million in Epstein's will — a bequest that raised questions about the nature of their relationship with him.

The investigation placed Juul among a small number of individuals facing criminal-level scrutiny in connection with the Epstein documents, distinguishing her case from the broader wave of resignations and institutional departures that followed the file releases. [Thorbjorn Jagland](/people/thorbjorn-jagland), another prominent Norwegian figure, separately faced fallout for his documented ties to Epstein.
