Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States, had a well-documented relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that has been subject to intense public scrutiny since Epstein's 2019 arrest.

## Documented Connections

Flight logs from Epstein's private Boeing 727, known colloquially as the "Lolita Express," show Clinton took at least 26 trips on the aircraft between 2001 and 2003. Some flights included multiple legs. Clinton has acknowledged using the plane but said it was for trips related to his philanthropic work through the Clinton Foundation.

Clinton visited Epstein's New Mexico ranch and was photographed with Ghislaine Maxwell on multiple occasions. Epstein also visited the Clinton White House and contributed to the Clinton Foundation.

## Clinton's Statements

Through a spokesperson, Clinton said in 2019 that he "knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to" and "had not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade." Clinton said he took a total of four trips on Epstein's plane, a claim contradicted by the flight logs which document significantly more flights.

In 2024, unsealed documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case included testimony mentioning Clinton, though no accuser has directly alleged criminal conduct by the former president.

## Ongoing Scrutiny

Clinton's name has appeared repeatedly in documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act. The nature and extent of his relationship with Epstein remain active subjects of journalistic investigation and public interest. Clinton has not been charged with any crime related to the Epstein case.
