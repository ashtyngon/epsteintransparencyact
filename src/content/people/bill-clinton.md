Bill Clinton's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is among the most extensively documented of any public figure's — and among the most difficult to fully assess. The flight logs are extensive. The photographs are numerous. The public statements have been carefully lawyered. And the central question — what exactly Clinton knew about Epstein's crimes — remains unresolved.

What distinguishes the Clinton-Epstein connection from many others in the case is the sheer volume of documented contact: at least 26 flight segments on Epstein's aircraft, trips with [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell), White House visits by Epstein, and Foundation donations. This is not a case of a name in a contacts book. It is a documented, multi-year association.

## How They Connected (Early to Mid-1990s)

The exact origin of the Clinton-Epstein relationship is not definitively established in any single primary source. Multiple reports indicate they became acquainted in the early-to-mid 1990s, during Clinton's presidency.

Ghislaine Maxwell is widely identified as the intermediary who introduced Epstein to Clinton's social circle. Maxwell had connections to Democratic political networks and New York society. Clinton aide Doug Band has also been identified in reporting as a key connector — Band traveled with Clinton on Epstein's plane and was present on the Africa trip.

The 2002 New York Magazine profile of Epstein by Landon Thomas Jr. placed Epstein within Clinton's orbit, quoting Epstein about the relationship and describing the social context.

## Epstein at the White House

White House visitor logs show Jeffrey Epstein visited the Clinton White House. Reporting has confirmed at least one documented visit, with some outlets identifying records suggesting additional visits in the early 1990s.

The exact count has varied across reports — from a single confirmed visit to as many as 17, depending on the source and methodology. The most rigorously documented claim is at least one visit. Clinton White House visitor logs are available through the National Archives under FOIA.

## The Flight Logs

This is the most extensively documented aspect of the relationship. Flight logs for Epstein's Boeing 727 — known colloquially as the "Lolita Express" — were subpoenaed and entered into evidence in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil lawsuit.

![A page from the flight manifests for Epstein's Boeing 727 listing passenger names](/images/documents/flight-logs-page.jpg)

Clinton's name appears on the flight manifests at least 26 times. However, this represents 26 flight *segments*, not 26 separate trips. A single round trip with a stop could generate three or four log entries. The flights are documented between approximately 2001 and 2003.

Clinton, through a spokesperson, claimed in 2019 that he took "a total of four trips" on Epstein's plane. Independent analyses — including by FactCheck.org — have noted that while multi-leg trips account for a significant portion of the gap between "4 trips" and "26 flights," the actual number of distinct trips may be five or six, not four. The Clinton statement appears to understate the number of trips.

The key destinations documented in the logs include countries in Africa (the September 2002 trip), Europe, and Asia, as well as various U.S. cities. No flight logs show Clinton as a passenger on flights to Little St. James Island — Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

## The Africa Trip (September 2002)

The single most documented trip is a multi-country journey through Africa in September 2002 on Epstein's Boeing 727. The stated purpose was a Clinton Foundation initiative related to HIV/AIDS relief and anti-poverty work — causes that were a major focus of the Foundation during this period.

Documented passengers on the Africa trip included:

- Bill Clinton
- Jeffrey Epstein (though some reports indicate Epstein may not have been on all legs)
- [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell)
- Doug Band (Clinton aide)
- Kevin Spacey
- Chris Tucker
- Members of Clinton's Secret Service detail
- Additional staff and associates

Countries visited reportedly included Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Mozambique, and South Africa.

This trip accounts for a large share of the flight log entries. A photograph from the trip, published by the New York Post in 2020, shows Clinton receiving a neck massage from Chauntae Davies — a former Epstein associate who has said she was a victim. Davies confirmed the photograph was real but told media she did not consider Clinton to have done anything inappropriate and that the massage was brief and consensual in a casual context.

## The Question of Little St. James

Whether Clinton visited Epstein's private island is one of the most persistent questions in the case. The available evidence is mixed:

**Against:** Flight logs — the primary documentary record — do not show Clinton as a passenger on flights to Little St. James. Clinton's representatives have consistently and specifically denied he ever visited the island.

**For:** Steve Scully, an Epstein island employee, told reporters in a 2011 interview that Clinton had visited. This claim has not been corroborated by flight logs or other documentary evidence.

[Virginia Giuffre](/people/virginia-giuffre), in unsealed documents, did not provide consistent accounts on this point. In some statements she referenced being told by Epstein or Maxwell that Clinton was on the island; in other depositions, she said she had no firsthand knowledge of Clinton on the island.

Based on available documentary evidence, the claim that Clinton visited Little St. James rests on a single uncorroborated account. The flight logs — the most comprehensive record available — do not support it.

## Clinton Foundation Donations

Epstein donated approximately $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation (some reports specify the Clinton Presidential Library fund). The donation was reportedly made in the early 2000s. The Clinton Foundation returned or re-directed the donation after Epstein's legal troubles became public.

Epstein also reportedly attended at least one Clinton Global Initiative event, though the exact nature and extent of his CGI involvement is less thoroughly documented than the personal interactions.

## Photographs with Maxwell

Multiple photographs exist of Clinton with Ghislaine Maxwell at various social events. The most widely circulated images show the two at what appear to be social and fundraising gatherings. Photographs from the Africa trip have also been referenced in reporting.

No photographs of Clinton on Little St. James Island have surfaced publicly. Notably, most documented photographs show Clinton with Maxwell rather than with Epstein directly.

## Clinton's 2019 Statement

After Epstein's arrest on July 6, 2019, Clinton issued a statement through spokesperson Angel Urena. The statement said Clinton "knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those combated in the indictment announced today in New York." It said Clinton had "not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade."

The statement acknowledged "a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane" — one to Europe, one to Asia, and one to Africa (for Clinton Foundation work), plus "one short flight within the United States." It said Clinton had "one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail."

The statement explicitly said Clinton had "never been to Little St. James Island."

As noted above, the "four trips" claim is contradicted or at least understated by the flight logs, which document significantly more flight segments than four trips would typically generate. FactCheck.org characterized the statement as potentially understating the number of trips.

## The Secret Service Question

Clinton had Secret Service protection as a former president. Secret Service agents are documented as having accompanied Clinton on some — but reportedly not all — of the flights on Epstein's plane. Flight logs show Secret Service personnel listed as passengers on several legs.

However, some flight legs do not list Secret Service personnel. This has raised questions about whether Clinton traveled without his detail on certain occasions. Alternative explanations include: agents may have traveled on separate aircraft, logging practices may not have consistently captured all passengers, or agents may have been listed under initials that weren't immediately identifiable.

The Secret Service has not publicly commented in detail on the specific arrangements for Clinton's travel on Epstein's aircraft. The question remains unresolved.

## The Post-Conviction Contact Question

Clinton's 2019 statement placed his Epstein contacts in the early 2000s — before Epstein's legal troubles. However, reporting — particularly from the New York Post — has indicated that Clinton visited Epstein's Manhattan townhouse in 2010 or 2011, after Epstein had served his Florida sentence for the 2008 plea deal.

Clinton's representatives have not specifically confirmed or denied a post-conviction visit. The distinction matters: contact before Epstein's conviction can be characterized as an association with a philanthropist; contact after the conviction — when Epstein was a registered sex offender — requires a different explanation.

## January 2024 Unsealed Documents

In January 2024, approximately 900 pages of documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case were unsealed by federal judge Loretta Preska. Clinton's name appeared in several contexts: references to Epstein's social circle, deposition excerpts mentioning Clinton as a flight passenger, and testimony from Johanna Sjoberg (another Epstein accuser) who mentioned Clinton in the context of Epstein or Maxwell referencing powerful friends.

The documents did not contain new allegations of criminal conduct by Clinton and largely confirmed what was already publicly known about the flight connections.

## Virginia Giuffre's Statements About Clinton

Giuffre's statements about Clinton are notably more restrained than her allegations against other individuals. When asked in a deposition whether she had sexual contact with Clinton, Giuffre said no. She has never accused Clinton of sexual misconduct or criminal conduct against her or anyone she personally witnessed.

This is an important distinction. Giuffre named numerous powerful men as participants in Epstein's trafficking operation — including Prince Andrew and [Alan Dershowitz](/people/alan-dershowitz). Clinton is not among them.

## Other Depositions Mentioning Clinton

Beyond Giuffre, Clinton has been mentioned in depositions by:

- **Johanna Sjoberg**, who referenced Clinton in the context of Epstein/Maxwell discussing powerful connections, but made no allegations of misconduct.
- **Epstein's household staff**, including house manager Juan Alessi, who mentioned Clinton as a visitor/connection but did not allege witnessing misconduct.
- **Epstein's pilots** Larry Visoski and David Rodgers, who confirmed Clinton as a passenger on flights, corroborating the logs.

No sworn testimony from any witness accuses Clinton of sexual misconduct in connection with Epstein.

## What Is and Is Not Established

Clinton has never been charged with any crime related to Epstein. No accuser has alleged sexual misconduct by Clinton in sworn testimony. Virginia Giuffre — the most prominent Epstein accuser — explicitly denied sexual contact with Clinton under oath.

What is established is that Clinton had extensive, multi-year documented contact with a man who was running a sex trafficking operation; that he traveled repeatedly on the plane of a man later convicted of trafficking minors; that he associated closely with Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of recruiting and grooming underage victims; and that his public statements about the extent of these contacts have been contradicted by the documentary record.

The Biden administration's DOJ under Merrick Garland declined to release the federal investigative files that might have provided more clarity on Clinton's role, citing ongoing investigations and grand jury secrecy. The Trump administration's approach — selective release with heavy redactions — has not resolved the questions either.

The passage of the Epstein Transparency Act may eventually provide a fuller picture. Until then, the documented record establishes extensive association but not criminal conduct — a distinction that is legally significant but, for many Americans following this case, insufficient.
