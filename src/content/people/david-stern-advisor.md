David Stern is documented in the Epstein files as a close associate of both [Prince Andrew](/people/prince-andrew) and [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). He maintained relationships with the British royal and the convicted financier, serving as an intermediary between elite circles. Details about his professional background and the full scope of his activities have not been extensively reported beyond his role in the visa incident.

## The Visa Advice

According to documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act and reported by The Guardian on February 14, 2026, Stern advised Epstein to illegally conceal his child sexual abuse conviction when applying for a Chinese visa. The correspondence shows Stern specifically advised against mentioning "being denied previously or criminal charges" on Epstein's visa application form.

The guidance came after Epstein's initial visa application was rejected by Chinese authorities. Epstein had been convicted in 2008 in Palm Beach County, Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Deliberately omitting a criminal conviction on a visa application constitutes fraud under both U.S. and international law.

The files do not indicate whether Epstein followed Stern's advice or whether he ultimately obtained the Chinese visa.

## Connection to Prince Andrew

Stern's role extends the documented connections between Epstein and Prince Andrew's inner circle. The prince claimed in his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview that his relationship with Epstein was limited and primarily conducted through mutual friends. Newly released emails in February 2026 directly contradicted several statements Andrew made during that interview, showing more frequent contact than the prince acknowledged and revealing coordination on travel and meetings.

Stern's position as an intermediary between the royal and Epstein places him among several advisers and associates who facilitated access between elite circles and the convicted sex offender. The files document similar patterns of assistance from individuals across multiple sectors — lawyers providing legal cover, consultants brokering introductions, and associates like Stern offering practical guidance to navigate bureaucratic obstacles.

## Legal Significance

The visa advice documented in the files represents a concrete instance of active assistance to a convicted sex offender in evading legal consequences. While many individuals named in the Epstein documents appear in the context of social events, business correspondence, or networking, Stern's documented role was specifically to help Epstein circumvent legal barriers arising from his criminal record.

## Context

Stern's revelation was part of a broader wave of disclosures showing how Epstein's network extended through facilitators who provided specific forms of assistance. A former Clifford Chance lawyer's ties were exposed in separate emails. Consultants pitched Epstein's access to New York Democrats in exchange for campaign contributions. The pattern described by victims' attorneys is one of a sophisticated operation requiring cooperation from advisers in law, finance, politics, and social circles.
