R. Alexander Acosta served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 to 2009. During that period, he oversaw the federal investigation into [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) and personally negotiated the non-prosecution agreement (NPA) that became the single most consequential — and most condemned — prosecutorial decision in the Epstein case. The deal allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges, plead to minor state offenses, serve a sentence designed to minimize actual incarceration, and secure immunity for unnamed co-conspirators who have never been prosecuted.

A federal judge later ruled that the deal violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act. Acosta went on to serve in [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump)'s cabinet — and resigned under pressure when the deal's terms became a subject of national outrage.

## The Federal Investigation

The investigation into Epstein began in March 2005 with the Palm Beach Police Department, which received a complaint from the mother of a 14-year-old girl. Chief Michael Reiter and Detective Joe Recarey conducted a thorough investigation that identified at least 36 underage victims and gathered substantial physical evidence from Epstein's Palm Beach estate, including hidden cameras, photographs, and massage tables.

Palm Beach police referred the case to the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office after concluding that Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer was not pursuing charges aggressively. A federal grand jury investigation was convened. FBI agents identified additional victims and built a case that, by 2007, had produced a 53-page draft federal indictment.

The draft indictment was ready to be filed. It would have charged Epstein with federal sex trafficking offenses that carried potential sentences of decades in prison. Multiple law enforcement officials involved in the investigation expected federal charges to follow.

## The Non-Prosecution Agreement

Instead, Acosta's office entered into negotiations with Epstein's defense team — which included [Alan Dershowitz](/people/alan-dershowitz), Kenneth Starr, Jay Lefkowitz, and Gerald Lefcourt. The result was the non-prosecution agreement, signed in September 2007 and finalized in June 2008.

The terms of the NPA were extraordinary:

- **State charges only**: Epstein pleaded guilty to two Florida state charges — one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of procurement of minors for prostitution. The federal charges were dropped.
- **13 months in county jail**: Epstein was sentenced to 18 months in the Palm Beach County Stockade — a county jail, not a federal prison. He served approximately 13 months.
- **Work release**: Epstein was granted work release six days a week, 12 hours a day. He was permitted to leave the jail and go to his office in downtown West Palm Beach. The work release arrangement was administered by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and, according to later reporting, involved remarkably loose supervision. Epstein's office received visits from young women during the work release period.
- **Sex offender registration**: Epstein was required to register as a sex offender.
- **Co-conspirator immunity**: The NPA included a clause granting immunity from federal prosecution to Epstein's unnamed co-conspirators. This provision effectively shut down any broader investigation into the network of individuals who facilitated Epstein's crimes — the recruiters, schedulers, and enablers who made the trafficking operation possible.
- **Victims not notified**: The agreement was negotiated and finalized without notifying the victims, as required by the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act.

The NPA was classified and kept sealed, meaning that the public — and the victims — did not know its full terms until years later.

## The Crime Victims' Rights Act Violation

In 2008, two of Epstein's victims — represented by attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell — filed a lawsuit arguing that the NPA violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), which guarantees crime victims the right to confer with the prosecutor and to be treated with fairness.

The case wound through the federal courts for more than a decade. On February 21, 2019, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra issued a landmark ruling: the government had violated the CVRA by keeping the victims in the dark about the plea agreement. Judge Marra wrote that prosecutors had an obligation to notify the victims and failed to do so.

The ruling was significant not only for the Epstein case but as a broader statement about victims' rights in federal prosecutions. It established that the government cannot negotiate a plea deal that affects crime victims without informing them.

The ruling came too late to undo the plea deal — Epstein had already served his sentence — but it placed the NPA's terms on the public record and contributed to the momentum that led to Epstein's 2019 federal arrest on new charges.

## "I Was Told to Leave It Alone"

In 2017, when Acosta was being vetted for the position of Secretary of Labor, he reportedly told Trump's transition team that he had been told to "leave it alone" because Epstein "belonged to intelligence." The remark was first reported by Vicky Ward in the Daily Beast.

Acosta has not publicly confirmed or denied the statement. He has not identified who told him to "leave it alone" or what intelligence agency was referenced. The remark has fueled extensive speculation about whether Epstein had connections to U.S. or foreign intelligence services — speculation that has never been confirmed or definitively refuted by any government agency.

If the statement is accurate, it raises the possibility that the lenient plea deal was influenced by factors beyond the evidence and the law — that national security or intelligence considerations played a role in protecting Epstein from federal prosecution. No official investigation has confirmed this.

## Nomination and Confirmation as Secretary of Labor

Despite his role in the Epstein plea deal, Acosta was nominated by President Trump to serve as Secretary of Labor in February 2017. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 27, 2017, on a vote of 60-38.

During his confirmation hearing, Acosta defended the plea deal, arguing that the state charges resulted in Epstein going to jail and registering as a sex offender — outcomes that, he suggested, would not have been guaranteed under a federal prosecution. He characterized the deal as the best outcome available given the circumstances and the state of the law at the time.

Senators questioned Acosta about the deal's terms, but the confirmation proceeded. The Epstein case was not yet the national story it would become.

## The Miami Herald Investigation

In November 2018, Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald published "Perversion of Justice," a multi-part investigative series that examined the 2008 plea deal in detail. Brown tracked down approximately 80 of Epstein's victims — far more than the 36 identified in the original Palm Beach investigation — and documented the leniency of the deal, the work release conditions, and the failure to notify victims.

The series brought national attention to the case and, specifically, to Acosta's role in the NPA. It was widely cited as a catalyst for the renewed federal investigation that led to Epstein's July 2019 arrest.

## Resignation

On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested on new federal sex trafficking charges by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. The arrest reignited scrutiny of the 2008 plea deal and of Acosta's role in it.

On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a press conference at the Department of Labor in which he defended the plea deal, argued that the case was handled appropriately given the legal landscape of 2008, and attempted to shift responsibility to the state attorney's office. The press conference was widely viewed as unsuccessful in deflecting criticism.

On July 12, 2019, Acosta resigned as Secretary of Labor, effective one week later. Trump, standing alongside Acosta at the White House, praised him as a "great" Labor Secretary and said the resignation was Acosta's decision. Acosta said he did not want the case to be "a distraction" from the administration's work.

## The Co-Conspirator Immunity Question

The immunity clause in the NPA remains one of the most significant and least resolved aspects of the case. By granting blanket immunity to unnamed co-conspirators, the agreement ensured that individuals who facilitated Epstein's trafficking — recruiters like Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova, schedulers like Lesley Groff, and potentially others — would never face federal prosecution for their roles.

The immunity clause effectively foreclosed the broader investigation that victims and law enforcement had hoped would follow Epstein's prosecution. Palm Beach Police Chief Reiter and Detective Recarey, who had built the case with the expectation that it would lead to a wider reckoning, expressed deep frustration.

The question of why Acosta agreed to co-conspirator immunity — protecting individuals who had not even been named, let alone charged — has never been satisfactorily answered. The "intelligence" remark, if accurate, provides one possible explanation. The pressure from Epstein's high-powered defense team provides another. The full answer may lie in the documents that have been released under the Epstein Transparency Act — or in those that remain redacted.

## What Is and Is Not Established

Acosta was not accused of criminal conduct. He was not alleged to have been aware of or involved in Epstein's crimes. His role was prosecutorial: he was the U.S. Attorney who had the authority and the evidence to pursue a federal case against Epstein and chose not to.

What is established is that Acosta's office negotiated a deal that allowed a serial child sex trafficker to serve 13 months in a county jail with work release privileges. The deal immunized his co-conspirators. It was conducted in secret, without notifying the victims. A federal judge ruled it violated the law. And Acosta reportedly told the incoming Trump administration that the deal was influenced by intelligence considerations that have never been publicly explained.

The plea deal is the single decision in the Epstein case that, more than any other, ensured that the trafficking operation and its participants were shielded from accountability for over a decade. Every year between 2008 and 2019 — during which Epstein moved freely among the powerful, continued to host visitors at his properties, and maintained his social network — was a year made possible by the terms Alexander Acosta negotiated.
