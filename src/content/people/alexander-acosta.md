Alexander Acosta served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 to 2009, during which time he negotiated the non-prosecution agreement (NPA) that became the most controversial legal decision in the Epstein case.

## The Plea Deal

Despite a federal investigation that identified at least 36 underage victims and a ready 53-page indictment, Acosta's office struck a deal allowing Epstein to plead guilty to two minor state prostitution charges. Under the NPA, Epstein served just 13 months in a county jail with generous work release privileges, and his unnamed co-conspirators received immunity from federal prosecution.

The deal was made without notifying the victims, which a federal judge later ruled violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act. The immunity clause for co-conspirators was particularly significant — it effectively shut down any broader investigation into Epstein's network.

## "Told to Leave It Alone"

Acosta reportedly told the Trump transition team in 2017 that he had been told to "leave it alone" because Epstein "belonged to intelligence." This remark, first reported by the Daily Beast, fueled widespread speculation about Epstein's possible ties to intelligence agencies.

## Secretary of Labor

Despite his role in the Epstein deal, Acosta was confirmed as Trump's Secretary of Labor in April 2017. Following the Miami Herald's "Perversion of Justice" investigation in 2018 and Epstein's July 2019 federal arrest, Acosta faced overwhelming pressure. He resigned on July 19, 2019.

## Legacy

Acosta's handling of the Epstein case became a symbol of institutional failure — a case where a federal prosecutor had the evidence and authority to pursue serious charges but instead allowed a wealthy, well-connected defendant to escape meaningful punishment.
