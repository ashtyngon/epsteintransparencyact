Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem served as Chairman and CEO of DP World, the Dubai-based global port operator that owns P&O Ferries and manages over 80 marine terminals across six continents. He was forced out of his position in February 2026 after documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act revealed extensive communications between him and [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein).

## DP World

DP World is one of the largest port operators in the world, handling approximately 10 percent of global container traffic. The company operates terminals in the UAE, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its subsidiary P&O Ferries operates major shipping routes in the English Channel and the Irish and North Seas. DP World is majority-owned by Dubai World, an investment arm of the Dubai government.

Bin Sulayem had led the company for years and was one of the most prominent business executives in the Gulf states.

## Appearance in the Epstein Files

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act revealed that Bin Sulayem's name appeared more than 4,700 times across the files — one of the highest mention counts for any individual in the released records. The documents included emails, scheduling records, and other communications between Bin Sulayem and Epstein.

The volume of mentions indicated a relationship that extended well beyond casual or incidental contact. The specific nature of the communications — what was discussed, whether financial arrangements were involved, and whether any of the contacts related to Epstein's criminal conduct — has been the subject of ongoing review by journalists and congressional investigators.

## Forced Departure

On February 13, 2026, DP World announced Bin Sulayem's departure. The company's statement described the change as part of a "strategic realignment" of leadership. The statement did not reference the Epstein files directly.

The timing, however, was unambiguous. The announcement came within days of the document releases that revealed the extent of Bin Sulayem's communications with Epstein. News outlets reported that the Dubai government and DP World's board moved quickly to distance the company from the fallout.

## Congressional Response

Rep. [Ro Khanna](/people/ro-khanna) (D-CA), co-author of the Epstein Transparency Act, cited Bin Sulayem's departure as evidence that the files contained information of genuine consequence about living individuals. Khanna demanded further name disclosures, arguing that if the documents were significant enough to force the resignation of a major global CEO, the public had a right to know who else was named.

Khanna and Rep. [Thomas Massie](/people/thomas-massie) (R-KY) pointed to the DP World case as proof that the DOJ's redactions were protecting powerful figures, not victims.

## Significance

Bin Sulayem's departure was one of the most consequential corporate exits triggered by the Epstein file releases, alongside [Kathryn Ruemmler](/people/kathryn-ruemmler)'s resignation from Goldman Sachs. The DP World case demonstrated the global reach of the Epstein revelations — extending from American politics and finance into the governance structures of sovereign wealth-backed enterprises in the Gulf.

The scale of his mentions in the files — more than 4,700 — raised questions about the depth and duration of Epstein's connections to powerful figures in the Middle East, and about what role those connections played in Epstein's financial and social network.
