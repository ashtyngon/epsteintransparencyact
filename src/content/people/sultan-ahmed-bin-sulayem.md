Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem served as Chairman and CEO of DP World, the Dubai-based port operator that owns P&O Ferries and manages over 80 marine terminals across six continents. He was forced out of his position in February 2026 after emails between him and Jeffrey Epstein surfaced in the latest round of document releases under the Epstein Transparency Act.

His departure was one of several high-profile corporate exits triggered by the January 2026 document release, alongside Goldman Sachs general counsel Kathryn Ruemmler.
