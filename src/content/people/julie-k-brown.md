Julie K. Brown is an investigative reporter for the Miami Herald whose work is widely credited as the single most important piece of journalism in the Epstein case.

## Perversion of Justice

In November 2018, Brown published the multi-part series "Perversion of Justice," which detailed how Epstein had avoided federal charges through a secret plea deal and how dozens of victims were denied justice. The investigation tracked down roughly 80 women who said they were molested or sexually abused by Epstein as teenagers.

The series documented how the original federal investigation under U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta had identified 36 underage victims, yet Epstein was allowed to plead to minor state charges and serve 13 months with work release.

## Impact

The investigation had immediate and lasting consequences:

- The FBI reopened its inquiry into Epstein
- Bipartisan calls for accountability intensified
- Epstein was arrested on new federal charges in July 2019
- Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigned under scrutiny
- The broader public became aware of the scope of Epstein's operation

## Book and Legacy

Brown expanded her reporting into the book "Perversion of Justice: The Jeffrey Epstein Story." She received numerous journalism awards for the series, which is considered a landmark of accountability journalism. Her work demonstrated the power of investigative reporting to reopen cases that institutional forces had tried to close permanently.
