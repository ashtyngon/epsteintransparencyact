Julie K. Brown is an investigative reporter for the Miami Herald whose work is widely credited as the single most consequential piece of journalism in the Epstein case. Her multi-part series "Perversion of Justice," published beginning in November 2018, exposed the full scope of [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s plea deal, tracked down dozens of his victims, and created the political conditions that led to his 2019 arrest on federal charges.

## Before the Investigation

By the time Brown began her investigation in 2017, the Epstein case had largely faded from public attention. Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges in Florida — a deal that allowed him to avoid federal sex trafficking charges, serve just 13 months in a county jail with daily work release, and register as a sex offender. The non-prosecution agreement, brokered by then-U.S. Attorney [Alexander Acosta](/people/alexander-acosta), was sealed and kept from the victims, in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act.

A decade later, Epstein was living freely in Manhattan, Palm Beach, and his private island. The case appeared closed.

## Perversion of Justice

Brown spent over a year reporting the series. She tracked down roughly 80 women who said they had been molested or sexually abused by Epstein as teenagers — far more than the 36 victims the original FBI investigation had identified. Many had never spoken to a reporter before. Some were found through public records, court filings, and painstaking door-to-door reporting across South Florida.

The first installment was published on November 28, 2018. The series documented:

- How the original FBI investigation had built a strong case for federal sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage victims
- How Acosta's office negotiated the non-prosecution agreement in secret, granting immunity not only to Epstein but to unnamed "co-conspirators"
- How victims were never notified of the plea deal, as required by federal law
- How Epstein's 13-month sentence was served largely outside jail on work release, during which he was chauffeured to a private office for up to 12 hours a day
- How Palm Beach police had identified a pattern of abuse as early as 2005 but were stymied by federal inaction

Brown also reported that Epstein's defense team had hired private investigators to follow and intimidate victims and their families, and that key figures in law enforcement and the legal system had failed to act on credible evidence.

## Impact

The investigation produced immediate and cascading consequences:

- The FBI reopened its inquiry into Epstein
- The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York began a new investigation
- On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport on federal sex trafficking charges
- Bipartisan pressure mounted in Congress for accountability
- [Alexander Acosta](/people/alexander-acosta), who had become Trump's Secretary of Labor, resigned on July 19, 2019, after the plea deal he had brokered came under intense public scrutiny
- A federal judge ruled in February 2019 that prosecutors had violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by failing to notify victims of the plea agreement

The series demonstrated that a single investigative reporter at a regional newspaper could reopen a case that the federal government, powerful defense attorneys, and institutional inertia had conspired to close.

## Book

Brown expanded her reporting into the book "Perversion of Justice: The Jeffrey Epstein Story," published by Dey Street Books in 2021. The book provided additional detail on her reporting process, the obstacles she encountered — including Epstein's legal team attempting to discredit her work — and the broader systemic failures that allowed a serial sex trafficker to operate with impunity for decades.

## Recognition

Brown received the George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award, and numerous other honors for the series. The Pulitzer Prize board cited "Perversion of Justice" as a finalist.

Her work is considered a landmark of accountability journalism — a case study in how investigative reporting can reopen cases that powerful interests believed were permanently closed. Every subsequent development in the Epstein case — from his 2019 arrest, to [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell)'s conviction, to the Epstein Transparency Act — traces its origin, directly or indirectly, to Brown's reporting.
