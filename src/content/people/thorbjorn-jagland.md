Thorbjorn Jagland is a Norwegian politician who held three of the most prominent positions in European governance and international diplomacy. He served as Prime Minister of Norway from 1996 to 1997, as chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 2009 to 2015 — the body that awards the Nobel Peace Prize — and as Secretary General of the Council of Europe from 2009 to 2019.

## Epstein Relationship

The New York Times reported on February 13, 2026 that Jagland maintained "mutually beneficial ties" with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). Newly released emails showed Jagland "promised influence" while Epstein "had gifts to give," according to the Times. The specific nature of the gifts Epstein provided and the influence Jagland offered have not been fully detailed in publicly available reporting.

The relationship overlapped with Jagland's tenure as Nobel Committee chairman (2009-2015), a period when he helped decide who received the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Committee's deliberations are traditionally shielded from outside influence for 50 years. The existence of documented exchanges of access for benefits between the committee's chairman and a convicted sex offender has prompted scrutiny of Nobel Committee processes during that period.

## Epstein's Use of the Nobel Connection

Separate documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act revealed that Epstein systematically leveraged his relationship with Jagland to recruit other prominent figures into his network. Files show Epstein name-dropped Jagland in invitations and messages to Richard Branson, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, and Steve Bannon, who later became chief strategist to President Trump in January 2017.

The pattern was consistent: Epstein would host Jagland, then reference those meetings when reaching out to other high-profile contacts. The Nobel connection provided a talking point that combined institutional prestige with personal access — a combination Epstein used across multiple industries and political affiliations.

## Institutional Weight

Jagland's dual roles in European governance and the Nobel institution made him a particularly valuable contact for Epstein's network-building strategy. Unlike celebrity scientists or academics previously exposed in the files, Jagland controlled access to one of the world's most prestigious awards. His position carried greater institutional weight than research funding or academic appointments.

The contacts between Epstein and Jagland occurred after Epstein's 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor and continued until close to Epstein's death on August 10, 2019.

## Criminal Charges

On Feb. 11, 2026, Norwegian police charged Jagland with gross corruption. Investigators stated they were examining "whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position," according to Norwegian authorities. The charges stem from Jagland's documented relationship with Epstein, which included Epstein providing gifts and travel to Jagland while Jagland was serving as Nobel Committee chairman.

Newly released emails added further detail to the relationship. In one exchange, Jagland emailed Epstein directly, asking to stay at Epstein's Paris apartment. In another, Epstein suggested that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov should contact Jagland — indicating Epstein sought to use Jagland as an intermediary in Russian diplomatic outreach.

## Context

Jagland's naming in the Epstein files placed him among the most prominent European figures documented in Epstein's network, alongside Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem of DP World and Lord Peter Mandelson. His case illustrated Epstein's method of embedding himself in institutions of global significance — not merely to associate with powerful individuals, but to use those associations as tools for expanding his network further. The criminal charges filed against Jagland in February 2026 represent one of the most significant legal consequences to emerge from the Epstein files for a European official.
