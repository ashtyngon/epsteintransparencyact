Tom Barrack is an American billionaire real estate investor who founded Colony Capital, a private equity firm that managed over $60 billion in assets before being rebranded as DigitalBridge Group. A decades-long confidant of [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump), Barrack served as chairman of the 2017 presidential inaugural committee, where he raised over $100 million for the event. He subsequently served as U.S. special envoy to the Middle East.

## Appearance in the Epstein Files

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act in February 2026 identified Barrack as having contact with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). CBS News reported, after reviewing the released files, that Barrack "networked and socialized" with Epstein for years. The report did not specify the exact timeframe, frequency, or nature of their interactions beyond networking and social events.

The files did not establish whether the relationship continued after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Palm Beach, Florida, or whether Barrack had direct business dealings with Epstein. Colony Capital operated in some of the same financial and real estate circles as Epstein's investment activities.

## Prior Legal Issues

Barrack was indicted in July 2021 on federal charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the United Arab Emirates and lying to the FBI. He was acquitted on all counts in November 2022. The Epstein file references are unrelated to that case.

## Political Significance

Barrack's appearance in the Epstein files is politically significant given his close ties to Trump. As chairman of the 2017 inaugural committee and a longtime presidential adviser, he is among the highest-ranking Trump associates named in the documents. His naming came as Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation on February 13, 2026, arguing that continued scrutiny served no public purpose.

## Ongoing Position

Unlike several European and corporate figures who resigned or were forced out after being named in the files — including DP World chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem and Goldman Sachs general counsel Kathryn Ruemmler — Barrack has retained his business positions and political connections. NPR reported in February 2026 that Barrack maintained his investment firm and his role as U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, highlighting a pattern in which American figures named in the documents have faced fewer professional consequences than their European counterparts.
