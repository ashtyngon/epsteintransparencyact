Dr. Thomas Magnani served on the faculty and in leadership roles at Columbia University's College of Dental Medicine. He is identified in documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act as [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s former personal dentist, a relationship that formed the basis of his documented contact with the financier.

## Admissions Role

Documents released in early 2026 revealed that Magnani served as the primary point of contact for securing the admission of Epstein's girlfriend to Columbia's College of Dental Medicine. The disclosure indicated that Magnani leveraged his faculty and volunteer leadership positions within the college to facilitate an admissions outcome connected to his relationship with Epstein. A second faculty member, [Dr. Letty Moss-Salentijn](/people/letty-moss-salentijn), was separately identified as having helped develop a personalized plan of study for the same woman once she was enrolled.

The case raised questions about how personal relationships with Epstein may have translated into preferential treatment within academic institutions and whether proper admissions procedures were followed.

## Columbia's Response

Columbia University announced on February 11, 2026 that it had cut all ties with Magnani. The university noted that Magnani had not taught at the college since 2017, but confirmed it had taken action to remove him from the admissions review committee and from all volunteer leadership roles he held within the institution. Unlike Moss-Salentijn, who retained her tenured faculty position, Magnani's complete removal from all Columbia affiliations represented a more thorough severing of institutional ties.

## Context

Magnani's case illustrated how Epstein's network could penetrate academic institutions through personal service relationships — in this instance, a dentist-patient connection that evolved into apparent facilitation of admissions favoritism. His role in the dental college's admissions and volunteer leadership structures provided a mechanism through which a personal obligation to Epstein could be acted upon within an institutional setting.
