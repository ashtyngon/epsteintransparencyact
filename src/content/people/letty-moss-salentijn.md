Dr. Letty Moss-Salentijn is a dental researcher and educator at Columbia University's College of Dental Medicine, where she holds a tenured faculty position. She had also served in a senior administrative role as a vice dean within the college, with responsibility over academic programs.

## Role in Epstein-Linked Admissions

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act revealed that Moss-Salentijn helped develop a personalized plan of study for a woman identified as [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s girlfriend, who was admitted to or enrolled at Columbia's College of Dental Medicine. The nature of the involvement suggested that standard academic processes were altered or supplemented to accommodate a candidate with a connection to Epstein. The documents did not indicate that Moss-Salentijn directly admitted the woman, but that she played a role in designing a tailored academic program for her.

The case involved a second Columbia faculty member, [Dr. Thomas Magnani](/people/thomas-magnani), who was identified as the primary point of contact for securing Epstein's girlfriend's admission to the dental college.

## Columbia's Response

Columbia University announced on February 11, 2026 that it was stripping Moss-Salentijn of her title as vice dean at the dental college as a result of the disclosures. The university stated that she would remain in her tenured faculty position — a distinction that reflects the protections afforded to tenured professors under Columbia's academic governance policies. The removal of the vice dean title represented a demotion in administrative standing without termination of her employment or academic appointment.

Columbia's simultaneous action against Magnani was more complete: the university cut all ties with him, removing him from the admissions review committee and all volunteer leadership roles, though it noted he had not taught at the college since 2017.
