Steven Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, a cognitive scientist, and a bestselling author of books including "The Language Instinct" (1994), "The Better Angels of Our Nature" (2011), and "Enlightenment Now" (2018). He became a figure in the Epstein story through his documented connections to [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein), including appearances in connection with Epstein's Harvard visits and a role in Epstein's legal defense.

## Background

Born in 1954 in Montreal, Canada, Pinker earned his PhD in experimental psychology from Harvard in 1979. He taught at Stanford and MIT before returning to Harvard in 2003. He is one of the most widely recognized public intellectuals in the English-speaking world, known for his work on language, cognition, and the history of violence. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004.

## Connection to Epstein

Pinker's name appeared in connection with Epstein's visits to Harvard's campus, where Epstein donated $9.1 million between 1998 and 2008 and visited at least 40 times after his 2008 conviction. Pinker flew on Epstein's private aircraft on at least one occasion, traveling to a TED conference in 2002 alongside other academics and public figures.

In 2007, Pinker provided a linguistic analysis to Epstein's legal team during Epstein's initial criminal case in Florida. Pinker offered an interpretation of the wording of a federal statute at the request of [Alan Dershowitz](/people/alan-dershowitz), his Harvard Law School colleague and a member of Epstein's defense team. Pinker later said the legal analysis was a professional favor for Dershowitz and that he was not paid for it.

## Public Statements

Pinker has publicly distanced himself from Epstein on multiple occasions. He stated that he was not a friend of Epstein, did not socialize with him, and found him "creepy." He has said that the 2002 flight was a one-time occurrence and that the legal opinion was provided to Dershowitz, not directly to Epstein.

Pinker has also said he attended two events at which Epstein was present — a dinner at Harvard and a meeting organized by Epstein — but described these as professional encounters rather than personal relationships. He told reporters in 2019 that he had no further contact with Epstein after the mid-2000s.

## Context

Pinker's case illustrates how Epstein's network of connections at Harvard drew in prominent academics through overlapping professional circles. The legal opinion provided via Dershowitz demonstrates how Epstein's defense team leveraged the intellectual credibility of Harvard faculty. While Pinker's involvement appears more peripheral than figures like Martin Nowak, who ran an Epstein-funded research program, his name in the Epstein orbit has contributed to the broader scrutiny of Harvard's institutional relationship with the convicted sex offender.
