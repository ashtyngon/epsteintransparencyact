Kathryn Ruemmler served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama and later became general counsel at Goldman Sachs. She resigned from Goldman Sachs in February 2026 after documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act revealed emails in which she referred to Jeffrey Epstein as "uncle Jeffrey."

The released emails showed a personal relationship with Epstein that extended over several years, including messages thanking him for gifts. Ruemmler's resignation was effective June 30, 2026.

Her departure was one of several high-profile corporate exits triggered by the January 2026 document release.
