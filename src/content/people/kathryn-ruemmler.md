Kathryn Ruemmler served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2014 and later became general counsel at Goldman Sachs, one of the world's largest investment banks. She resigned from Goldman Sachs in February 2026 after documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act revealed personal emails between her and [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein), including messages in which she referred to him as "Uncle Jeffrey."

## Background

Ruemmler is a graduate of Georgetown University Law Center and built a distinguished legal career in government before moving to the private sector. She served as a federal prosecutor in the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, where she helped lead the fraud prosecution of Enron executives. President Obama appointed her as White House counsel in June 2011, making her one of the youngest people and the second woman to hold the position.

After leaving the White House in 2014, Ruemmler joined the law firm Latham & Watkins before being named general counsel of Goldman Sachs in 2020 — one of the most senior legal positions on Wall Street.

## The "Uncle Jeffrey" Emails

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act in January and February 2026 included emails between Ruemmler and Epstein. The emails revealed a personal relationship that extended over several years. In multiple messages, Ruemmler referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey" — a term of familiar affection that drew immediate public attention.

The released communications also included messages in which Ruemmler thanked Epstein for gifts and social invitations. The emails indicated contact that continued after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea to state prostitution charges and his registration as a sex offender — a period during which many public figures distanced themselves from him.

The specific nature of any professional or financial relationship between Ruemmler and Epstein has not been fully established by the released documents.

## Resignation from Goldman Sachs

On February 13, 2026, Goldman Sachs announced that Ruemmler would step down as general counsel. Her resignation was effective June 30, 2026. The bank's statement did not reference the Epstein files directly but stated that the transition was "mutual."

The timing aligned precisely with the public release of the emails. Reporting by Axios and Reuters indicated that Goldman Sachs moved to manage the reputational risk after the "Uncle Jeffrey" emails became public.

## Significance

Ruemmler's resignation was one of several high-profile corporate departures triggered by the Epstein file releases, alongside [Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem](/people/sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem)'s forced exit from DP World. Her case was notable for the intersection of the Epstein network with the highest levels of both government and Wall Street — a former White House counsel who became a top Goldman Sachs executive, maintaining a familiar personal relationship with a convicted sex offender.

The emails raised questions about how Epstein maintained relationships with powerful legal and financial figures even after his 2008 conviction, and about the extent to which those relationships provided him access to institutional power.
