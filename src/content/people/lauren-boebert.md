Lauren Boebert, a Republican congresswoman representing Colorado, was one of four Republicans to sign the discharge petition forcing a floor vote on the Epstein Transparency Act.

## Signing the Petition

Boebert signed the petition on September 2, 2025, alongside Massie, Mace, and Greene. She had publicly stated earlier that "the American people deserve and can handle the truth" regarding the Epstein files.

## Situation Room Confrontation

On November 12, 2025 — the day the petition was set to reach 218 signatures with the swearing-in of Rep. Adelita Grijalva — Boebert was brought into a White House Situation Room meeting in a last-ditch attempt to convince her to withdraw her name. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy AG Todd Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel were present.

Boebert refused to remove her signature. The meeting was later cited as evidence of the extraordinary lengths the administration went to in attempting to block the bill.

## Significance

Boebert's refusal to back down, particularly in the face of a direct Situation Room pressure campaign, demonstrated that the political cost of opposing Epstein transparency had become greater than the cost of defying party leadership. Her stand helped ensure the petition reached its 218-signature threshold.
