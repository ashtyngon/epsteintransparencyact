Lauren Boebert, a Republican congresswoman representing Colorado's 4th district, was one of four Republicans who signed the discharge petition forcing a floor vote on the Epstein Transparency Act. Her refusal to withdraw her signature — even when summoned to the White House Situation Room — became one of the most dramatic moments in the transparency fight.

## Signing the Petition

Boebert signed the discharge petition on September 2, 2025, alongside [Thomas Massie](/people/thomas-massie), [Nancy Mace](/people/nancy-mace), and [Marjorie Taylor Greene](/people/marjorie-taylor-greene). She had publicly stated earlier that summer that "the American people deserve and can handle the truth" regarding the Epstein files.

Like Greene, Boebert had been a prominent Trump-aligned voice in Congress. Her decision to sign the petition placed her in direct conflict with the White House, which had labeled Republican support for the discharge petition "a very hostile act to the administration."

## The Situation Room Confrontation

The most significant moment in Boebert's role in the Epstein transparency fight came on November 12, 2025 — the day the discharge petition was set to reach 218 signatures with the swearing-in of Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ).

Boebert was brought into a meeting in the White House Situation Room. Present were Attorney General [Pam Bondi](/people/pam-bondi), Deputy AG Todd Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel. The meeting represented a last-ditch effort by the administration to prevent the petition from succeeding by convincing Boebert to remove her name.

Boebert refused. The meeting, later reported by CNN, was cited by members of both parties as evidence of the extraordinary lengths the administration went to in attempting to block the Epstein Transparency Act. Using the Situation Room — a facility designed for national security deliberations — to pressure a member of Congress on a transparency bill drew particular scrutiny.

## Aftermath

Unlike [Marjorie Taylor Greene](/people/marjorie-taylor-greene), who broke with Trump entirely and resigned from Congress, Boebert did not publicly sever ties with the broader Republican coalition. Her stand was framed as a specific act of conscience rather than a wholesale political realignment.

The Situation Room episode became a defining moment in the narrative of the Epstein files fight, illustrating the degree to which the administration treated transparency as a threat. The bill passed the House 427-1 on November 18, 2025 — six days after the administration's final attempt to stop it.
