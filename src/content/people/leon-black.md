Leon Black is the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, one of the world's largest private equity firms, with over $500 billion in assets under management. He paid [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) $158 million for tax and estate planning services between 2012 and 2017 — all after Epstein's 2008 conviction.

## $158 Million in Payments

In January 2021, Apollo's board commissioned an independent review by the law firm Dechert LLP into Black's relationship with Epstein. The review found Black had paid Epstein $158 million for professional services related to tax planning, estate planning, and philanthropy advice between 2012 and 2017.

The Dechert review concluded that the payments were for "legitimate professional services" and found "no evidence" that Black participated in or was aware of Epstein's criminal activities. Black stated the relationship was "strictly professional."

The $158 million figure drew scrutiny because of its scale — it exceeded what major accounting and legal firms typically charge for comparable services. Black's representatives said the fees reflected the complexity and value of the tax strategies Epstein helped implement, which saved Black significantly more than the fees paid.

## Departure from Apollo

Black stepped down as Apollo's CEO in March 2021, following the Dechert review. He remained as chairman before departing that role in 2022. He stated his departure was related to personal health issues, though the timing coincided with sustained public pressure over the Epstein payments.

## 2026: School Districts Sever Lifetouch Contracts

In February 2026, [school districts began canceling contracts with Lifetouch](/news/2026-02-15-leon-black-named-in-epstein-files-schools-cancel-photo-day), the school photography company, after social media users highlighted corporate connections between Lifetouch and Black through Apollo's investment portfolio. Lifetouch was acquired by Shutterfly in 2018; Apollo had investment relationships with companies in Lifetouch's corporate family.

[Multiple additional districts severed ties](/news/2026-02-18-school-districts-sever-lifetouch-ties-over-epstein-black-revelations) as the story spread, and [Central Dauphin School District in Pennsylvania issued a public response](/news/2026-02-19-central-dauphin-school-district-responds-to-lifetouch-epstein-link) to parent concerns about the Lifetouch connection.

## What Is Established

Black has never been charged with any crime in connection with Epstein. The board-commissioned review found no evidence of involvement in criminal activity. What is established is that Black maintained a paid professional relationship with Epstein for five years after Epstein's conviction, paying $158 million in fees — and that the institutional consequences of that relationship extended to school districts across the country in 2026.
