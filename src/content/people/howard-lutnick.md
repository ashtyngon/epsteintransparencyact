Lutnick's name surfaced in files released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law). The specific nature and timing of his contacts with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) have not been publicly detailed in the released documents.

## GOP Concerns

No senators have publicly called for his resignation, and no formal investigation into his contacts has been announced.

The senatorial concerns add to broader Republican tensions over the administration's handling of the Epstein files. Rep.

[Thomas Massie](/people/thomas-massie) labeled the current government the "Epstein Administration" over disputes about document redactions.
