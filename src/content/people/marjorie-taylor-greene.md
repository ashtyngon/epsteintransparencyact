Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congresswoman from Georgia, became an unexpected central figure in the Epstein transparency fight when she broke with President Trump over the release of files.

## MAGA Loyalist

Greene had built her political career as one of Trump's most vocal and aggressive defenders in Congress. She was known for combative rhetoric and unwavering loyalty to the MAGA movement, making her decision to defy the president on the Epstein issue particularly significant.

## The Break

On September 2, 2025, Greene was one of four Republicans — alongside Thomas Massie, Nancy Mace, and Lauren Boebert — who signed the discharge petition to force a floor vote on the Epstein Transparency Act. In July, she had posted that she "will never protect pedophiles or the elites and their circles."

Trump responded by un-endorsing Greene and publicly attacking her as a "traitor," "wacky," and a "disgrace."

## "MAGA Was a Lie"

During the House floor debate on the bill, Greene gave an emotional speech about being branded a traitor for demanding accountability for sex trafficking victims. In subsequent statements, she declared that "MAGA was a lie" if it meant protecting powerful people at the expense of survivors.

## Resignation

Greene announced she would not serve out her term, citing the impossibility of remaining effective after losing support from both party leadership and the president. Her resignation took effect in early January 2026.

Her trajectory — from the movement's fiercest defender to outcast over child trafficking accountability — became one of the most discussed political narratives of 2025.
