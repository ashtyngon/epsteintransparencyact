Virginia Giuffre (born Virginia Roberts) is one of the most prominent accusers in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Her willingness to speak publicly, file civil lawsuits, and name powerful individuals made her a central figure in bringing the Epstein network to public scrutiny.

## Allegations

Giuffre has alleged that she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago at age 16 while working as a spa attendant. She says she was subsequently trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell to numerous powerful men over a period of years, traveling internationally for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

## Legal Actions

Giuffre filed multiple civil lawsuits that became critical to public understanding of the Epstein case:

Her defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell (Giuffre v. Maxwell) produced thousands of pages of sealed court documents. The gradual unsealing of these documents — particularly a major release in January 2024 — named numerous high-profile individuals and provided detailed accounts from depositions and testimony.

She also filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, which was settled out of court in February 2022. Prince Andrew made no admission of wrongdoing.

## Significance

Giuffre's advocacy extended beyond her own case. She became a spokesperson for Epstein survivors more broadly, calling for transparency, accountability, and the release of all sealed documents. Her willingness to publicly identify herself and name powerful individuals, at considerable personal risk, was instrumental in maintaining public pressure on the case.
