Sarah Ferguson is the former wife of [Prince Andrew](/people/prince-andrew), Duke of York, and a published author. She was married to Prince Andrew from 1986 to 1996 and has two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

## Post-Conviction Contact with Epstein

Documents released by the DOJ in February 2026 showed Ferguson sent messages to [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The specific content, timing, and frequency of these messages were reported by The Guardian but not fully detailed in public accounts.

## Six Companies Filed for Closure

[Six companies linked to Ferguson filed for dissolution](/news/2026-02-16-sarah-ferguson-s-6-companies-to-close-after-epstein-files) through Companies House, the UK's corporate registry, shortly after the document release. The applications were submitted after details of her post-conviction contact with Epstein became public.

The closures followed a broader pattern of corporate consequences for individuals named in the files. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files), [Dubai's DP World chief stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), and [Casey Wasserman sold his talent agency](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) after Epstein-related revelations.

## Earlier Epstein Connection

Ferguson's connection to Epstein predates the 2026 revelations. In 2011, she acknowledged that Epstein had given her £15,000, a payment arranged through Prince Andrew. She told the BBC at the time that accepting the money was "a gigantic error of judgment" and said she was "totally and utterly used."

Prince Andrew's friendship with Epstein — facilitated through [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell) — has been the subject of separate and more extensive scrutiny, including a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, which was settled in 2022.

## What Is Established

Ferguson has never been charged with any crime in connection with Epstein. She acknowledged the 2011 payment and called it an error. The 2026 document release added a new dimension: evidence of direct messages to Epstein after his conviction, and the subsequent closure of six businesses. The full scope of her contact with Epstein beyond these documented interactions has not been publicly established.
