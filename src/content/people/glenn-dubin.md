Glenn Dubin is a billionaire hedge fund manager and co-founder of Highbridge Capital Management, which was later acquired by JPMorgan Chase. He maintained a decades-long personal and social relationship with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein).

## Family Connections to Epstein

Dubin's wife, Dr. Eva Andersson-Dubin, a former Miss Sweden, previously dated Epstein in the 1980s before her marriage to Dubin. The Dubin family maintained social ties with Epstein through the 2000s. The family's children referred to Epstein in familiar terms, according to reporting by the New York Times.

Court filings revealed that a young woman who worked as the Dubins' au pair was later connected to Epstein's network. The specific circumstances were detailed in sealed depositions that were partially unsealed in 2019.

## Virginia Giuffre's Allegations

Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most prominent accusers, alleged in sworn testimony that Epstein directed her to have sex with Dubin. The allegation was contained in depositions taken as part of a defamation lawsuit against [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell).

Dubin has denied the allegation through his attorneys. In a statement, his representatives called the claims "categorically false" and said Dubin "never engaged in any inappropriate behavior."

Giuffre's allegations were detailed in court documents that were unsealed in August 2019 and January 2024 as part of ongoing litigation related to Epstein's network.

## Social and Financial Ties

The Dubins were among Epstein's closest social associates. They attended events together, and Epstein was a guest at Dubin family gatherings. The relationship continued after Epstein's 2008 conviction — Dubin was among the people who wrote a letter to the court on Epstein's behalf during the 2008 proceedings.

Dubin's co-founding of Highbridge Capital, which managed billions in assets, placed him among the wealthiest figures in Epstein's social circle.

## What Is Established

Dubin has never been charged with any crime. He has denied Virginia Giuffre's allegations. What is documented is a decades-long close personal relationship with Epstein that included family ties through his wife's prior relationship, social events, and association that continued after the 2008 conviction. The allegations against Dubin have been made in sworn testimony but have not been tested at trial.
