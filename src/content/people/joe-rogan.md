Joe Rogan is the host of The Joe Rogan Experience, one of the most-listened-to podcasts in the world with an estimated audience of roughly 14 million listeners per episode. He is also a comedian and longtime UFC commentator. Rogan is not an Epstein associate. He appears in the Epstein files solely because Epstein attempted — and failed — to arrange a meeting with him through an intermediary.

## Exactly How Rogan Appears in the Files

Rogan's name appears in a **September 2017 email exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss**. The emails, released as part of the January 30, 2026 DOJ document dump under the Epstein Transparency Act, show the following sequence:

1. **Epstein to Krauss:** Shortly after Krauss appeared as a guest on The Joe Rogan Experience, Epstein emailed Krauss saying he had seen the Rogan interview and asked Krauss to introduce him to Rogan, adding that he thought Rogan was funny.
2. **Krauss to Epstein:** Krauss replied that he would reach out to Rogan.
3. **Krauss to Epstein (follow-up days later):** Krauss reported back that Rogan had not responded, writing that Rogan seemed "more timid than I would have thought."

That is the full extent of Rogan's appearance in the Epstein files. The introduction attempt failed. No meeting between Rogan and Epstein occurred. No direct correspondence between Rogan and Epstein exists anywhere in the released documents.

Rogan is **not** in Epstein's black book or contact list. He does **not** appear in any flight logs. There is **no** evidence of any direct communication between Rogan and Epstein.

A secondary, incidental connection: Epstein was a UFC fan who subscribed to UFC promotional emails and ordered pay-per-view events. As the UFC's lead commentator, Rogan's name may appear in promotional materials in Epstein's email inbox, but this reflects Epstein's consumer interest in UFC, not any personal connection to Rogan.

## Rogan's Own Account

Rogan addressed his appearance in the files on Episode #2451 of The Joe Rogan Experience, with guest Cheryl Hines (wife of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.). Rogan stated he is in the files "for not going" — that Krauss had tried to arrange the meeting but Rogan declined after looking up Epstein online. Rogan said he found information about Epstein's 2008 conviction and wanted nothing to do with him.

## Commentary on the Epstein Case

Rogan's most significant role in the Epstein story has been as a commentator with massive reach. In a February 2026 podcast episode, Rogan told Black Rifle Coffee Company chair [Evan Hafer](/people/evan-hafer) that the Epstein files "scare the s--- out of me" and called them "definitely not a hoax." He said, "This is the one that I hate the most."

His comments were broadcast to millions of listeners during a period when the files had already forced out executives at Goldman Sachs and DP World, and triggered congressional subpoenas for Les Wexner and Lord Peter Mandelson.

## Earlier Criticism of Trump Administration

In July 2025, Rogan delivered sustained criticism of the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files on his July 17 episode. He called the FBI's sudden dismissal of trafficking evidence "the gaslightiest gaslighting shit I've ever heard in my life," referring to the bureau's reversal after months of the administration hyping the files. Rogan described the Epstein issue as "a line in the sand" — a test of whether the administration's anti-establishment rhetoric was real or performative.

Given Rogan's perceived influence on the 2024 presidential election and his enormous audience, his sustained criticism across multiple episodes through the summer of 2025 was seen as particularly damaging to the administration. His break with Trump over the Epstein files contributed to a broader fracture in the MAGA media ecosystem, alongside similar criticism from Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and Charlie Kirk.

## Contrast with Other Media Figures

Rogan's approach to being named in the files — acknowledging the mention and providing full context — contrasted with that of other media personalities. British broadcaster [Piers Morgan](/people/piers-morgan), who appeared 29 times in the files, publicly disputed and refused to accept that his name was in the documents. The two responses illustrate different strategies adopted by public figures confronted with their documented proximity to Epstein's network.
