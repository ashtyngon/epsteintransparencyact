Joe Rogan is the host of The Joe Rogan Experience, one of the most-listened-to podcasts in the world with an estimated audience of roughly 14 million listeners per episode. He is also a comedian and longtime UFC commentator. Rogan is not an Epstein associate — he is included in this directory because of his prominent role in public commentary on the Epstein files and because his own name appeared in released documents.

## Named in the Files

Rogan's name surfaced in documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act. He addressed the mention on his podcast, acknowledging it and providing context. The nature of the mention — whether it reflected direct contact, a reference in correspondence, or something else — has not been fully detailed. Being named in the files does not itself indicate wrongdoing; [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s operation maintained extensive records of contacts, communications, and social connections across media, politics, and business.

## Commentary on the Epstein Case

Rogan's most significant role in the Epstein story has been as a commentator with massive reach. In a February 2026 podcast episode, Rogan told Black Rifle Coffee Company chair Evan Hafer that the Epstein files "scare the s--- out of me" and called them "definitely not a hoax." He said, "This is the one that I hate the most."

His comments were broadcast to millions of listeners during a period when the files had already forced out executives at Goldman Sachs and DP World, and triggered congressional subpoenas for Les Wexner and Lord Peter Mandelson.

## Earlier Criticism of Trump Administration

In July 2025, Rogan delivered sustained criticism of the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files on his July 17 episode. He called the FBI's sudden dismissal of trafficking evidence "the gaslightiest gaslighting shit I've ever heard in my life," referring to the bureau's reversal after months of the administration hyping the files. Rogan described the Epstein issue as "a line in the sand" — a test of whether the administration's anti-establishment rhetoric was real or performative.

Given Rogan's perceived influence on the 2024 presidential election and his enormous audience, his sustained criticism across multiple episodes through the summer of 2025 was seen as particularly damaging to the administration. His break with Trump over the Epstein files contributed to a broader fracture in the MAGA media ecosystem, alongside similar criticism from Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and Charlie Kirk.

## Contrast with Other Media Figures

Rogan's approach to being named in the files — acknowledging the mention and providing context — contrasted with that of other media personalities. British broadcaster Piers Morgan, who appeared 29 times in the files, publicly disputed and refused to accept that his name was in the documents. The two responses illustrate different strategies adopted by public figures confronted with their documented proximity to Epstein's network.
