Piers Morgan is a British broadcaster, journalist, and television presenter. He served as editor of the Daily Mirror from 1995 to 2004, hosted CNN's Piers Morgan Live from 2011 to 2014, and currently hosts Piers Morgan Uncensored on TalkTV. He has built a career on provocative interviewing and outspoken commentary, making him one of the most recognizable media figures in the United Kingdom and internationally.

## Appearance in the Epstein Files

Morgan's name appears 29 times in documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act, according to a detailed breakdown published by BuzzFeed. The outlet titled its investigation "Piers Morgan Wouldn't Accept His Name Is In The Epstein Files" and published a catalogue of all 29 mentions.

The files were among the 3.5 million pages released by the Department of Justice following the Epstein Transparency Act, which passed the House 427-1, passed the Senate unanimously, and was signed into law on November 19, 2025.

The 29 mentions appeared primarily in connection with social events and potential media projects, according to reporting from The Guardian. The specific contexts of the individual mentions — whether they reflected invitations, correspondence, third-party references, or other forms of documentation — have been catalogued by BuzzFeed but not comprehensively summarized in other reporting.

## Morgan's Response

Morgan has publicly disputed and refused to accept that his name appears in the documents. His denial has persisted despite BuzzFeed's published breakdown documenting each of the 29 instances. Morgan has not provided an alternative explanation for the documented mentions.

His approach stands in contrast to other media figures named in the files. Podcast host Joe Rogan, whose name also appeared in the released documents, acknowledged the mention on air and provided context about the nature of the reference. The two responses illustrate different strategies by public figures confronted with their documented proximity to [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s network.

## Context

Being named in the Epstein files does not itself prove wrongdoing. Epstein maintained extensive records of contacts, communications, and social connections across media, finance, politics, and academia. For comparison, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem of DP World appeared more than 4,700 times in the files and was subsequently forced out as CEO. The significance of 29 mentions depends on the nature and context of each reference.

Morgan's 29 mentions indicate multiple documented points of contact within the networks Epstein maintained. The documents are public. Morgan continues to dispute the reports.
