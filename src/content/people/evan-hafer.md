Evan Hafer is the founder, CEO, and chairman of Black Rifle Coffee Company, a veteran-owned coffee brand, and a podcast host. He became part of the Epstein files narrative through a widely covered conversation with Joe Rogan in which Rogan made his most extensive public comments about the Epstein document releases.

## Background

Hafer is a U.S. Army veteran who served in the Special Forces (Green Berets) and as a CIA contractor. He founded Black Rifle Coffee Company in 2014, positioning it as a veteran-owned, pro-military brand. The company went public in February 2022 through a SPAC merger, trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Hafer hosts his own podcast and regularly appears in conversations with other media figures in the conservative and veteran-adjacent media space.

## Role in Epstein Files Coverage

In February 2026, Hafer was the interviewer during a podcast conversation in which Joe Rogan delivered his most notable comments about the Epstein files. During the exchange, Rogan told Hafer that the Epstein files "scare the s--- out of me" and called them "definitely not a hoax." Rogan added, "This is the one that I hate the most."

The conversation, reported by The Hill, took place days after Rogan's own name appeared in the Epstein files — making his reaction, delivered to Hafer on the podcast, particularly significant. Rogan hosts one of the most-listened-to podcasts in the world, and his comments amplified public attention to the document releases at a moment when the files had already forced resignations at Goldman Sachs and DP World and triggered congressional subpoenas for [Leslie Wexner](/people/leslie-wexner) and Lord Mandelson.

## Context

Hafer is not alleged to have any personal connection to [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). His role in the Epstein story is as the interviewer who prompted and facilitated one of the most widely reported media moments in the Epstein files coverage. The Rogan-Hafer conversation helped move the Epstein files discussion into mainstream podcast media, reaching millions of listeners who may not follow traditional news coverage of the case.

Hafer's platform — which reaches a predominantly conservative, veteran, and male audience — represents one of the channels through which the Epstein files story has penetrated beyond its initial political and legal circles into broader public consciousness.
