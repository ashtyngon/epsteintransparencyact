Joi Ito is a Japanese-American activist, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist who served as director of the MIT Media Lab from 2011 until his resignation on September 7, 2019. He stepped down after investigative reporting by The New Yorker and other outlets revealed that he had actively concealed the scope of the Media Lab's financial relationship with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein), including efforts to disguise the source of donations.

## Background

Born in 1966 in Kyoto, Japan, and raised partly in the United States, Ito built a career at the intersection of technology, venture capital, and internet culture. He was an early investor in companies including Twitter, Flickr, and Kickstarter. He served on the boards of the New York Times Company, the John S. and John D. MacArthur Foundation, and the Knight Foundation. He was named director of the MIT Media Lab in April 2011, succeeding co-founder Nicholas Negroponte.

## The Epstein Financial Relationship

Epstein donated a total of $850,000 to MIT, channeled through the Media Lab. The New Yorker's September 2019 investigation, based in part on internal emails provided by whistleblower Signe Swenson, revealed that Ito and other MIT administrators had classified Epstein as a "disqualified" donor after his 2008 conviction — meaning his name was not to appear in any official records. Despite this designation, the lab continued to accept his money.

Internal emails showed that Ito and his staff used the label "he who shall not be named" when referring to Epstein in communications about donations. Funds from Epstein were directed through intermediaries to obscure their origin. Ito also solicited donations from others at Epstein's direction, with Epstein acting as a fundraising intermediary who connected Ito to wealthy individuals including Bill Gates.

In addition to institutional donations, Ito accepted a $525,000 personal investment from Epstein in funds managed by Ito's venture capital practice. Ito also visited Epstein's townhouse at 9 East 71st Street in Manhattan on multiple occasions.

## Resignation and Aftermath

Ito resigned on September 7, 2019, hours after The New Yorker published its detailed account of the concealed relationship. In his resignation letter, Ito apologized for his "connections with Jeffrey Epstein" and acknowledged that he had "used poor judgment." His departure was followed by the resignations of several Media Lab staff members and advisors, including Negroponte.

MIT launched a fact-finding investigation led by the law firm Goodwin Procter, which reported its findings in January 2020. The review confirmed that senior MIT officials were aware of Epstein's donations and that the university's development office had facilitated the acceptance of funds from a disqualified donor. MIT President L. Rafael Reif apologized but remained in his position until stepping down in December 2022 for unrelated reasons.

## Broader Significance

The MIT Media Lab scandal was a pivotal moment in the Epstein story, demonstrating how elite academic institutions not only accepted money from a convicted sex offender but actively worked to hide the relationship. The case illustrated the mechanisms by which Epstein maintained his influence after his 2008 conviction — using donations and investment connections to bind prominent individuals and institutions into a web of complicity and concealment.
