Miroslav Lajčák is a Slovak diplomat with an extensive career in European and international institutions. He served as Slovakia's Foreign Minister from 2009 to 2017 and was president of the United Nations General Assembly during its 72nd session in 2017-2018. He later served as the European Union's special representative for the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue — a role focused on normalizing relations between Serbia and Kosovo — before taking on the position of national security adviser to Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.

## The Emails

Documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act included emails between Lajčák and [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) in which the two appeared to banter about young women. The specific content and dates of the emails were not detailed in full in publicly available reporting, but the tone of the correspondence was sufficient to prompt his resignation from a sensitive national security role. The emails indicated a familiarity between Lajčák and Epstein that went beyond a purely professional acquaintance.

## Resignation

Lajčák stepped down as national security adviser to Prime Minister Fico on January 31, 2026, following the release of the emails. His departure was among the earlier resignations in the wave of fallout that followed the Epstein file releases, preceding a series of similar departures in early February 2026 across Europe and the United States.

## Context

Lajčák's case illustrated the international scope of Epstein's network, which extended into central European security and diplomatic circles in addition to the more heavily covered connections in Western Europe and the United States. His resignation from a national security post — a role with access to sensitive governmental intelligence and policy — underscored the particular concern raised when individuals documented in close contact with Epstein held positions of security responsibility.
