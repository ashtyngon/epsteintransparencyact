Carl Higbie is a conservative media personality and host of "Carl Higbie Frontline" on Newsmax. A former Navy SEAL, Higbie became a significant figure in the Epstein files discourse in February 2026 when he publicly accused the Trump Department of Justice of orchestrating a "cover-up" by redacting names from documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act.

## Background

Higbie served as a Navy SEAL with SEAL Team Two and completed deployments to Iraq. After leaving the military, he entered media and political commentary. He briefly served in the Trump administration as a spokesman for the Corporation for National and Community Service in 2018 before resigning after past controversial statements surfaced. He subsequently became a host on Newsmax, where he built a following as a conservative commentator.

## Role in Epstein Files Coverage

On February 12, 2026, Higbie used his Newsmax broadcast to deliver a pointed attack on the [Trump](/people/donald-trump) administration's handling of the Epstein document releases. Despite Newsmax's generally supportive coverage of the Trump administration, Higbie broke with that pattern, accusing the DOJ of hiding names that the Epstein Transparency Act was designed to make public.

"I want somebody to go to jail," Higbie said on air, demanding criminal accountability for officials responsible for the redactions. His criticism went beyond calling for better processes — he specifically called for prosecution of DOJ officials who authorized the redactions.

## Significance of the Criticism

Higbie's attack on the Trump DOJ was notable because it came from within the conservative media ecosystem. Newsmax had been a largely supportive platform for the Trump administration, making the on-air accusation of a "cover-up" a significant break from the expected editorial line. The criticism reflected growing frustration among some conservative commentators that the Epstein Transparency Act, which [President Trump](/people/donald-trump) signed on November 19, 2025 after it passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously, was not being fully implemented.

Higbie's demand for accountability came during the same period that [Attorney General Pam Bondi](/people/pam-bondi) faced questioning about the scope and completeness of the document releases. The DOJ had released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos, but the documents arrived heavily redacted, with names and other identifying information blacked out.

## Context

Higbie is not alleged to have any personal connection to Jeffrey Epstein. His role in the Epstein story is as a media commentator and transparency advocate. His willingness to criticize the administration he generally supports over the Epstein file redactions illustrates how the case has cut across traditional political alliances, creating pressure for disclosure from both the left and the right.
