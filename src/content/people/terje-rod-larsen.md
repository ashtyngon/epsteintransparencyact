Terje Rød-Larsen is a Norwegian diplomat who served as president and chief executive of the International Peace Institute, a New York-based think tank focused on international peace and security. He previously held senior United Nations positions and played a notable role in Middle East diplomacy, including involvement in the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. He is married to diplomat [Mona Juul](/people/mona-juul).

## Earlier Resignation and Epstein Ties

Rød-Larsen's connection to [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) first became a matter of public record in 2020, when documents revealed he had received donations and a personal loan from Epstein. Following those disclosures, Rød-Larsen resigned as president and chief executive of the International Peace Institute. The circumstances of the loan and donations, including their amounts and terms, drew significant scrutiny given Epstein's background as a convicted sex offender.

## The $10 Million Bequest

Newly unsealed documents made public in early 2026 revealed that Rød-Larsen and his wife, Mona Juul, had been left $10 million in Epstein's will. The bequest indicated that the financial relationship between the couple and Epstein was more extensive than had been established by the 2020 disclosures. Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges.

## Criminal Investigation

Norwegian police opened a corruption investigation into Rød-Larsen and Juul as of February 8, 2026. The investigation centers on the financial dealings between the couple and Epstein. Rød-Larsen's case represents one of the more documented financial entanglements in the released files, combining a personal loan, institutional donations, and a multimillion-dollar testamentary bequest — spanning a period that included years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
