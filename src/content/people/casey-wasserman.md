Casey Wasserman is a Los Angeles entertainment executive who founded and led Wasserman Media Group, one of the most influential talent and sports marketing agencies in the industry. He is the grandson of Lew Wasserman, the legendary entertainment mogul who built MCA into a dominant force in Hollywood. Wasserman, 51, served as chairman of the LA 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games organizing committee, making him the public face of Los Angeles's preparations for the Summer Olympics.

## Appearance in the Epstein Files

Documents released by the Department of Justice under the Epstein Transparency Act in February 2026 exposed email correspondence between Wasserman and [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell), [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s longtime associate and convicted sex trafficker. Maxwell was convicted on December 29, 2021 on five counts of sex trafficking and conspiracy, and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. The emails between Wasserman and Maxwell were dated 2003, predating Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Palm Beach County, Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

The New York Times reported that the emails showed "flirtatious exchanges" between Wasserman and Maxwell. The specific content and full scope of the communications have not been publicly detailed beyond that characterization.

## Professional Fallout

The exposure of the Maxwell emails triggered a rapid professional collapse. Clients including pop star Chappell Roan and soccer player Abby Wambach cut ties with Wasserman Media Group after the correspondence became public. The agency, which represented artists including Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, and Kendrick Lamar, faced a devastating client exodus.

Wasserman resigned from his position as chairman of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee. He subsequently announced the sale of Wasserman Media Group, telling staff he had "become a distraction" due to "past personal mistakes." The International Olympic Committee did not publicly comment on his departure.

## Context

Wasserman's fall was among the highest-profile corporate casualties of the Epstein document releases. His case was notable because the entertainment industry had largely escaped the initial waves of resignations that struck finance and logistics — Goldman Sachs general counsel Kathryn Ruemmler resigned over "Uncle Jeffrey" emails, and DP World chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem was forced out after appearing more than 4,700 times in the files. Wasserman's exit extended the accountability wave into sports and entertainment.

The agency has not disclosed the full extent of client departures or provided a timeline for the sale. Wasserman has not publicly addressed the specific content of the Maxwell emails beyond his general statement to staff.
