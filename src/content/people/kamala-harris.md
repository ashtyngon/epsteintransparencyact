Kamala Harris served as Vice President of the United States from January 2021 to January 2025 under President Joe Biden. A former Attorney General of California and U.S. Senator, Harris became a notable figure in the Epstein transparency debate when she publicly addressed the Biden administration's handling of the files after leaving office.

## Explaining the Biden Approach

During the Biden presidency, the DOJ under Attorney General Merrick Garland declined to release federal Epstein records, citing ongoing investigations, grand jury secrecy, and the Maxwell appeal. The decision drew bipartisan criticism.

In December 2025, Harris addressed the issue on Jimmy Kimmel Live — the first time a senior Biden administration official spoke at length about the decision. She framed it as a constitutional principle: "The President of the United States should not be telling the Department of Justice what to investigate, who to prosecute, or what files to release. That is a line we should not cross."

Drawing on her prosecutorial background, Harris added: "I spent my career in law enforcement. I know what happens when politicians start directing prosecutions. It doesn't end well for anyone — and it especially doesn't end well for victims."

## The Contrast

Harris's explanation drew an implicit but clear contrast with the Trump administration, which had used the DOJ politically — first hyping the files as a campaign promise, then attempting to suppress them after Trump learned his name appeared in the documents, then releasing selectively redacted versions that protected powerful figures while leaking survivor identities.

Legal scholars largely agreed with Harris's description of DOJ independence as a foundational norm. Some survivors' advocates, while acknowledging the principle, noted that the Biden administration could have pursued legislative or executive solutions that facilitated transparency without directing specific prosecutorial decisions.
