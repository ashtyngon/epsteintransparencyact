Kamala Harris served as Vice President of the United States from January 2021 to January 2025 under President Joe Biden. A former Attorney General of California and U.S. Senator, Harris became a notable figure in the Epstein transparency debate due to the Biden administration's decision not to release federal Epstein files.

## Involvement in Epstein File Debate

During the Biden presidency, the Department of Justice under Attorney General Merrick Garland declined to release federal records related to the Epstein investigation, citing ongoing investigations, grand jury secrecy, and the Maxwell appeal. As Vice President, Harris did not publicly comment on the DOJ's position during her tenure.

In December 2025, after leaving office following her defeat in the 2024 presidential election, Harris addressed the issue during a widely viewed appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. She defended the Biden administration's approach by invoking the principle of DOJ independence — arguing that the President and Vice President should not direct the Attorney General to release or withhold files for political reasons.

## Public Response

Harris's explanation drew a mixed response. Legal scholars and some former DOJ officials agreed that maintaining independence between the White House and law enforcement is a critical constitutional norm. Critics and survivors' advocates argued the principle was being used to shield inaction, noting that transparency and prosecutorial independence are not inherently in conflict.

The exchange highlighted the political complexity of the Epstein file issue and the tension between institutional norms and public accountability.
