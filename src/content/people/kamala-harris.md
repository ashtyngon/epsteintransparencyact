Kamala Harris served as Vice President of the United States from January 2021 to January 2025 under President Joe Biden. A former Attorney General of California and U.S. Senator, Harris is a minor figure in the Epstein transparency story, but she became notable for publicly articulating the Biden administration's rationale for not releasing the files.

## The Biden Administration's Position

During the Biden presidency, the DOJ under Attorney General Merrick Garland declined to release federal Epstein records, citing ongoing investigations, grand jury secrecy, and [Ghislaine Maxwell](/people/ghislaine-maxwell)'s appeal. The decision drew bipartisan criticism, with advocates arguing the administration was prioritizing institutional caution over victims' rights to transparency.

Neither Biden nor Harris addressed the issue publicly while in office.

## Post-Election Explanation

In December 2025, after leaving office, Harris addressed the Epstein files on Jimmy Kimmel Live — the first time a senior Biden administration official spoke at length about the decision. She framed it as a constitutional principle: the President should not direct the Department of Justice on what to investigate, who to prosecute, or what files to release.

Drawing on her prosecutorial background, Harris argued that political interference in DOJ decisions undermines the justice system. She drew an implicit contrast with the Trump administration, which had first hyped the files as a campaign promise, then attempted to suppress them after learning of [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump)'s presence in the documents.

## Context

Legal scholars largely agreed with Harris's description of DOJ independence as a foundational norm. Some survivors' advocates, while acknowledging the principle, noted that the Biden administration could have pursued legislative solutions — such as supporting the Epstein Transparency Act earlier — that facilitated disclosure without directing specific prosecutorial decisions.

Harris was not involved in any Epstein-related investigations and has no documented connection to Epstein or his associates.
