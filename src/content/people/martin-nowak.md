Martin Nowak is a professor of biology and mathematics at Harvard University and the founding director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED), a research center established in 2003 with a $6.5 million donation from [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein). Nowak's long-running professional and financial relationship with Epstein made him one of the most prominent academic figures implicated in the Epstein funding scandal.

## Background

Born in 1965 in Vienna, Austria, Nowak is a mathematical biologist whose research focuses on evolutionary dynamics — the mathematical principles that govern evolution, cooperation, and the behavior of complex biological systems. He earned his PhD from the University of Vienna and held positions at the University of Oxford and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton before joining the Harvard faculty.

Nowak is widely published, with over 500 papers in journals including Nature and Science, and is the author of "Evolutionary Dynamics" (2006) and "SuperCooperators" (2011). He is a fellow of the Royal Society.

## The Epstein-Funded Program for Evolutionary Dynamics

In 2003, Epstein donated $6.5 million to Harvard to establish the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, with Nowak as its founding director. The donation was the largest single component of the $9.1 million that Epstein gave to Harvard between 1998 and 2008. The program was housed in Harvard's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and focused on applying mathematical models to biological processes including cancer research, infectious disease, and evolutionary theory.

Epstein's name appeared on the program's advisory board, and he visited the Harvard campus repeatedly in connection with the program. According to reporting by the Harvard Crimson and the New York Times, Epstein visited Harvard at least 40 times after his 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor. Nowak was among the faculty who met with Epstein during these post-conviction visits.

## Continued Contact After the 2008 Conviction

Nowak's contact with Epstein did not end with the 2008 conviction. He continued meeting with Epstein on campus and, according to reporting, maintained a professional relationship that extended through the subsequent decade. The nature of these meetings — whether they involved additional funding discussions, research collaboration, or social interaction — has not been fully disclosed.

Harvard's 2020 internal review, ordered by then-President Lawrence Bacow, acknowledged that Epstein had visited the campus extensively after his conviction and that faculty and administrators had facilitated those visits. The review did not result in disciplinary action against Nowak or other faculty members. Critics, including Harvard faculty and student groups, called the review inadequate and demanded greater transparency about who at the university maintained relationships with Epstein.

## Significance

Nowak's case represents one of the most direct examples of Epstein's strategy of using targeted academic funding to buy access and intellectual prestige. A $6.5 million donation to create a named research program gave Epstein a permanent institutional foothold at Harvard — a reason to visit campus, meet with faculty, and present himself as a serious science philanthropist. The fact that this access persisted after a sex crimes conviction underscores the difficulty institutions faced in severing ties with a donor who had embedded himself into their intellectual infrastructure.
