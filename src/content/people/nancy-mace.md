Nancy Mace, a Republican congresswoman representing South Carolina's 1st congressional district, became one of four Republicans who signed the Epstein files discharge petition, defying direct pressure from the White House.

## Personal Stakes

Mace is a survivor of sexual violence, having publicly shared her experience of being raped at age 16. She has said this personal history made the Epstein transparency issue "deeply personal" and non-negotiable.

After meeting with Epstein survivors at the Capitol, Mace reportedly left in tears. She described their stories as reinforcing her determination to support the discharge petition regardless of political consequences.

## Defying the White House

When the White House pressured her to remove her name from the petition, Mace held firm. She communicated directly with Trump via direct message explaining why she was supporting the bill. Publicly, she posted that she would "defend every last attack on President Trump to the death" on other issues but would "NEVER abandon other survivors."

## Significance

Mace's stand was notable because she positioned it not as a break with Trump generally, but as a singular moral line she would not cross. Unlike MTG, who left the party's orbit entirely, Mace maintained her broader support for the administration while firmly holding her ground on the Epstein issue.
