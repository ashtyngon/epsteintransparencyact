Nancy Mace, a Republican congresswoman representing South Carolina's 1st congressional district, was one of four Republicans who signed the Epstein files discharge petition. A survivor of sexual violence, Mace framed her stand as a personal moral line that no political pressure could move.

## Personal Stakes

Mace has publicly shared her experience of being raped at age 16. She has spoken about how that experience shaped her perspective on sexual violence and institutional accountability, making the Epstein transparency issue non-negotiable for her regardless of political consequences.

After meeting with Epstein survivors at the Capitol during the discharge petition period, Mace reportedly left in tears. She described their testimony as reinforcing her determination to support the bill.

## Signing the Petition

On September 2, 2025, Mace signed the discharge petition alongside [Thomas Massie](/people/thomas-massie), [Marjorie Taylor Greene](/people/marjorie-taylor-greene), and [Lauren Boebert](/people/lauren-boebert). The four Republican signatures, combined with unified Democratic support, put the petition on track to reach the 218-signature threshold.

## Defying the White House

When the White House pressured Mace to remove her name from the petition, she held firm. She communicated directly with [Donald Trump](/people/donald-trump) via direct message, explaining why she was supporting the bill. Publicly, she posted that she would "defend every last attack on President Trump to the death" on other issues but would "NEVER abandon other survivors."

This framing distinguished Mace from [Marjorie Taylor Greene](/people/marjorie-taylor-greene), who broke with Trump entirely. Mace positioned her stand not as a repudiation of Trump or the MAGA movement, but as a singular, immovable moral principle. She maintained her broader support for the administration while drawing a clear line on the Epstein issue.

## Significance

Mace's approach demonstrated that members of Congress could defy the White House on the Epstein files without necessarily breaking with the president on all other issues. Her framing as a survivor — rather than as a political dissident — made her position difficult for the administration to attack publicly, and her refusal to back down contributed to the petition's success.
