Joanna Rubinstein served as chair of Sweden for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, a leadership role within the Swedish fundraising and advocacy arm of the United Nations refugee agency. Prior to that role, she had a career spanning philanthropy and international development, with connections to global health and humanitarian organizations.

## Private Island Visit

Newly unsealed documents released in early February 2026 revealed that Rubinstein and her family had visited [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) on his private island — Little Saint James in the U.S. Virgin Islands — in 2012. Epstein's island was later identified as a central location of his alleged sex trafficking operation, and visits to the island by prominent figures have drawn particular scrutiny during the document release process.

The visit occurred four years after Epstein's 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Little Saint James, which Epstein purchased in 1998, became one of several properties named in civil and federal proceedings related to his conduct.

## Resignation

Rubinstein resigned as chair of Sweden for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees following the public disclosure of the island visit. She did not offer a detailed public statement about the nature of her relationship with Epstein or the circumstances of the 2012 trip. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees is the world's principal refugee agency; its Swedish branch focuses on fundraising and awareness campaigns.

Her case was among several announced in the same week in February 2026, alongside that of former French culture minister [Jack Lang](/people/jack-lang), as international institutions moved to limit reputational damage from the ongoing document releases.
