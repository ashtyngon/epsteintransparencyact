Ro Khanna is a Democratic U.S. Representative from California who has become one of the most vocal advocates for full transparency in the Epstein case.

In February 2026, Khanna reviewed Epstein files at the Department of Justice alongside Rep. Thomas Massie. He subsequently took the extraordinary step of naming six individuals from the House floor whose identities had been redacted from official releases. He specifically labeled billionaire Leslie Wexner an FBI-designated "co-conspirator" in Epstein's sex trafficking operation.

Khanna has called for additional names to be made public and has demanded accountability for powerful figures connected to Epstein.
