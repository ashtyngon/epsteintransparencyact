Bill Gates is the co-founder of Microsoft and co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He met [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) on multiple occasions between 2011 and 2014 — years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida.

## Documented Meetings

The New York Times reported in October 2019 that Gates met with Epstein at least six times, including visits to Epstein's Manhattan townhouse and at least one dinner at the residence. The meetings began in 2011, three years after Epstein's conviction and release from a Florida county jail.

Gates has stated the meetings concerned discussions about philanthropy and global health initiatives. He told the Wall Street Journal in 2021 that "meeting with Epstein was a mistake," and that "I recognize I made an error in judgment."

The New York Times reported that in 2011, Gates emailed colleagues about Epstein, writing that his "lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not be for me." Employees at the Gates Foundation also met with Epstein to discuss potential funding mechanisms for global health projects, though no charitable partnership materialized.

## Melinda French Gates and the Divorce

In a March 2022 interview with CBS, Melinda French Gates said she was "disturbed" by her then-husband's meetings with Epstein. She stated the meetings were "one of the factors" in their divorce, which was finalized in August 2021 after 27 years of marriage.

French Gates said she met Epstein once, in 2013, and that she "wanted nothing to do with" him afterward, describing him as "evil personified."

## 2026 Developments

In February 2026, Gates [withdrew from a scheduled appearance at an artificial intelligence summit in India](/news/2026-02-19-bill-gates-withdraws-from-india-ai-summit-over-epstein-ties) as questions about his Epstein association resurfaced amid new document releases under the Epstein Transparency Act. The withdrawal coincided with broader public scrutiny of individuals connected to Epstein following DOJ file releases.

## What Is Established

Gates has never been accused of any criminal conduct in connection with Epstein. No allegations of sexual misconduct have been made against him in this context. The documented facts are: he met Epstein multiple times after the 2008 conviction, the meetings were known to his then-wife and to Gates Foundation staff, and no philanthropic partnership resulted from the meetings. Gates has acknowledged the meetings were a mistake in judgment.
