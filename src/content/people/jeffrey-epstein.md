Jeffrey Edward Epstein was an American financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and related offenses. He was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on August 10, 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Epstein had previously pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges in Florida in 2008 under a controversial plea agreement. His 2019 arrest on federal charges brought renewed scrutiny to his activities and connections.

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in 2025, mandates the release of federal records related to his activities.
