Sarah Kellen served as [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein)'s personal assistant and was identified by federal prosecutors as one of four potential co-conspirators in the 2008 non-prosecution agreement. She received immunity under that deal, which was negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta.

## Role in Epstein's Operation

Multiple victims described Kellen's role in sworn depositions and police interviews. According to the Palm Beach Police Department investigation and subsequent court filings:

- Kellen scheduled "appointments" between Epstein and underage girls
- She maintained contact lists and phone records used in recruitment
- Victims identified her as a person who coordinated logistics for encounters at Epstein's Palm Beach residence
- She was present in the house during alleged abuse

The Miami Herald's reporting on the 2008 plea deal described Kellen as one of several women who functioned as intermediaries between Epstein and his victims.

## The 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement

Kellen was one of four named potential co-conspirators who received immunity under the 2008 federal plea deal. The deal, negotiated in secret, allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor rather than face federal sex trafficking charges. The co-conspirators received blanket immunity from federal prosecution.

The deal was later found to have violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act because prosecutors failed to notify victims before finalizing it. Acosta's role in the deal became a subject of national scrutiny when he was appointed U.S. Secretary of Labor in 2017; he resigned from that position in 2019 after the Miami Herald's investigation.

## Later Life

Kellen later married and changed her name to Sarah Kellen Vickers. She has not made public statements about her role in Epstein's operation. She was not prosecuted after Epstein's 2019 arrest on new federal charges, as the immunity agreement from 2008 remained in effect.

## What Is Established

Kellen was named as a potential co-conspirator by federal prosecutors. Victims identified her as playing a logistical role in Epstein's abuse. She received immunity and was never charged. Her exact knowledge of and participation in the criminal activity — beyond what victims described in sworn statements — has not been tested in court.
