Jes Staley is a former chief executive of Barclays and a former senior executive at JPMorgan Chase. His relationship with [Jeffrey Epstein](/people/jeffrey-epstein) led to his departure from Barclays and figured centrally in JPMorgan's $290 million settlement with Epstein's victims.

## 1,200 Emails with Epstein

Court filings in the JPMorgan litigation revealed that Staley exchanged approximately 1,200 emails with Epstein between 2008 and 2012, while Staley was running JPMorgan's private banking division and later its investment bank. The correspondence continued after Epstein's 2008 conviction.

The emails were described in court filings as ranging from personal to professional in nature. Some included Epstein proposing introductions between Staley and other wealthy individuals. Staley visited Epstein at his estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands on multiple occasions.

## Departure from Barclays

In November 2021, Staley stepped down as CEO of Barclays after the UK's Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority investigated his characterization of his relationship with Epstein to the Barclays board. The regulators examined whether Staley had been sufficiently transparent with his employer about the nature and extent of his Epstein ties.

Barclays said it was "made aware of the preliminary conclusions" of the investigation and that Staley had "sufficiently" described his relationship to the board. Staley contested the regulators' characterization and said he would "vigorously" defend himself.

## JPMorgan Settlement

JPMorgan Chase settled a class action lawsuit brought by Epstein's victims for $290 million in June 2023. The lawsuit alleged the bank had maintained Epstein as a client despite internal warnings about his conduct, and that Staley's personal relationship with Epstein influenced the bank's decision to retain him as a client.

JPMorgan separately sued Staley, seeking to recover potential settlement costs by arguing he had been personally responsible for maintaining the bank's relationship with Epstein.

## What Is Established

Staley has not been charged with any crime. He has denied knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities. What is documented is that he maintained extensive personal correspondence with Epstein after the conviction, visited Epstein's properties, and that these ties ultimately cost him his position at one of the world's largest banks and contributed to his former employer paying $290 million to trafficking victims.
