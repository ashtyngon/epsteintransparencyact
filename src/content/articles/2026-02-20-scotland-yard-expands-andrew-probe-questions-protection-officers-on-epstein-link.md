Scotland Yard announced Friday it is contacting all former protection officers who worked with Prince Andrew and reviewing London airport flight records as part of an expanded inquiry into his connections to Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Metropolitan Police said officers are being asked to "consider carefully whether anything they saw or heard" may be relevant to the review of Epstein files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The force is also examining records of flights at London airports to determine if they were used for human trafficking.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The expanded inquiry is separate from the investigation that led to Andrew's arrest Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, according to the Metropolitan Police.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> [Prince Andrew was arrested Thursday](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-on-document-sharing-charges-in-epstein-case) following document releases under the Epstein Transparency Act.

## Multiple Complex Investigations

The Metropolitan Police said the multiple investigations now focused on King Charles's brother are "complex" in nature.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The decision to approach all former protection officers represents an expansion of Scotland Yard's inquiry into Andrew's activities related to Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Protection officers accompany members of the royal family during official and private travel.

Andrew has faced scrutiny over his friendship with Epstein since the financier's 2008 conviction on state charges in Florida. Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Andrew gave a November 2019 BBC Newsnight interview defending his friendship with Epstein and denying allegations made by Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked to Andrew when she was 17. Andrew settled a civil lawsuit with Giuffre in February 2022 for an undisclosed sum while admitting no liability.

Queen Elizabeth II stripped Andrew of his military titles and royal patronages in January 2022. King Charles removed Andrew's remaining royal role following his accession to the throne in September 2022.

Scotland Yard's announcement comes one day after Andrew's arrest and as [the Giuffre family said their "broken hearts were lifted"](/news/2026-02-19-giuffre-family-broken-hearts-lifted-by-andrew-s-arrest) by news of the charges against him.
