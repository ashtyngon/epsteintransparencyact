# New York Times Deploys Two Dozen Journalists to Review Millions of Epstein Files

**The New York Times** has assigned **24 journalists** to analyze a massive trove of **Jeffrey Epstein documents** that would physically stack as high as the Empire State Building if printed, according to an article published **February 13, 2026**. The investigation aims to uncover new revelations in the sprawling case that has captured international attention.

This large-scale journalistic effort signals continued public and media interest in the Epstein case, even as advocates push for the passage of the Epstein Transparency Act to ensure systematic public access to sealed documents. The Times' commitment of resources demonstrates that major news organizations believe significant undisclosed information remains buried in the millions of pages of files.

## Scale of the Document Review

The sheer volume of **Epstein files** under review is staggering. According to the Times, the stack of pages would reach **the height of the Empire State Building** — approximately 1,454 feet or roughly 145,000 pages if using standard document thickness estimates.

The **two dozen journalists** assigned to the project represent a significant resource commitment by the publication. The team is working to identify previously unreported information within the sprawling collection of documents related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates.

## Ongoing Investigative Efforts

The Times describes its work as "an effort to find the next revelation" in the case, suggesting the news organization expects to uncover new information that has not yet been made public. The source does not specify which particular document sets the journalists are reviewing or whether they have already made discoveries.

The investigation comes amid broader calls for transparency in the Epstein case, including legislative efforts to mandate the release of sealed court documents and government files through the proposed Epstein Transparency Act.

As the Times' investigation continues, the public can expect potential new reporting based on the team's analysis of the extensive document collection. The timeline for publication of any findings was not disclosed.
