**The New York Times** has assigned **24 journalists** to analyze a trove of **Jeffrey Epstein documents** that would physically stack as high as the Empire State Building if printed, according to an article the Times published **February 13, 2026**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The investigation comes after the **January 30, 2026** DOJ release of approximately **3 million documents** related to Epstein's activities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Large portions of the released files remain redacted by the FBI and DOJ.

## Scale of the Document Review

According to the Times, the stack of pages would reach **the height of the Empire State Building** — approximately 1,454 feet.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The **24 journalists** assigned to the project represent a significant resource commitment. The team is working to identify previously unreported information within the collection of documents related to Epstein's activities and associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Ongoing Investigative Efforts

The Times describes its work as a search for new information in the files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The investigation follows the Times' earlier examination titled "The Epstein Files and the Hidden World of an Unaccountable Elite."

The document releases have already been followed by the resignation of **Goldman Sachs top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler**, the departure of **DP World chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem** (who appeared more than 4,700 times in the files, according to the Times), congressional subpoenas for **Les Wexner** and **Lord Peter Mandelson**, and reporting on Epstein's connections to institutions from **Harvard** ($9.1 million in donations) to the **Nobel Committee** (where chairman **Thorbjorn Jagland** maintained contact with Epstein).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The investigation comes amid broader calls for transparency, particularly after the **Epstein Transparency Act** mandated document release but the FBI and DOJ continued to redact significant portions. Attorney General **Pam Bondi** has faced bipartisan pressure over the redaction policy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The timeline for publication of the Times' findings was not disclosed.
