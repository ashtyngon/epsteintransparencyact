# New York Times Deploys Two Dozen Journalists to Review Millions of Epstein Files

**The New York Times** has assigned **24 journalists** to analyze a massive trove of **Jeffrey Epstein documents** that would physically stack as high as the Empire State Building if printed, according to an article published **February 13, 2026**. The investigation aims to uncover new revelations in the sprawling case that has captured international attention.

This large-scale journalistic effort signals continued public and media interest in the Epstein case. The investigation comes after the **January 30, 2026** DOJ release of approximately **3 million documents** related to Epstein's criminal activities. The Times' commitment of resources demonstrates that major news organizations believe significant undisclosed information remains buried in the files, particularly given that large portions remain redacted by the FBI and DOJ.

## Scale of the Document Review

The sheer volume of **Epstein files** under review is staggering. According to the Times, the stack of pages would reach **the height of the Empire State Building** — approximately 1,454 feet or roughly 145,000 pages if using standard document thickness estimates.

The **two dozen journalists** assigned to the project represent a significant resource commitment by the publication. The team is working to identify previously unreported information within the sprawling collection of documents related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates.

## Ongoing Investigative Efforts

The Times describes its work as "an effort to find the next revelation" in the case, suggesting the news organization expects to uncover new information that has not yet been made public. The investigation follows the Times' earlier examination of the files, titled "The Epstein Files and the Hidden World of an Unaccountable Elite," which concluded Epstein was "a sexual predator given a free ride by the ruling class."

The document releases have already prompted the resignation of **Goldman Sachs top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler**, the departure of **DP World chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem** (who appeared more than 4,700 times in the files), congressional subpoenas for **Les Wexner** and **Lord Peter Mandelson**, and revelations about Epstein's connections to institutions from **Harvard** ($9.1 million in donations) to the **Nobel Committee** (where chairman **Thorbjorn Jagland** maintained ties with Epstein).

The investigation comes amid broader calls for transparency, particularly after the **Epstein Transparency Act** mandated document release but the FBI and DOJ continue to redact significant portions. Attorney General **Pam Bondi** has faced bipartisan pressure over the redaction policy.

The timeline for publication of the Times' findings was not disclosed.
