Rep. Thomas Massie told ABC News he no longer has confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi following a House hearing Wednesday over the Justice Department's handling of Epstein files.

The Kentucky Republican's statement breaks with his own party's Justice Department leadership. Massie said he disapproves of how Bondi conducted herself during the congressional testimony about DOJ redaction practices on Epstein documents.

## Republican vs. Republican

Massie has pushed for fuller disclosure of Epstein files despite party control of both the executive branch and Congress. The Wednesday hearing centered on [why the DOJ continues to heavily redact Epstein files](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) despite the Epstein Transparency Act becoming law.

Bondi defended the redactions as necessary to protect ongoing investigations and privacy rights. Massie argued the law mandated broader disclosure.

Days before his statement to ABC, [Massie criticized the Trump DOJ's file redactions](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions), calling them excessive and contrary to congressional intent. Last week, [he declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted on the DOJ to explain its redaction criteria.

## Bondi Under Fire

The attorney general has faced multiple controversies over Epstein file handling. She was [accused of monitoring which Democrats searched for Epstein-related documents](/news/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches). She also [named dead celebrities in public statements about Epstein email lists](/news/2026-02-15-bondi-named-dead-celebrities-in-epstein-email-list).

The DOJ has released millions of pages under the transparency law but maintained extensive redactions citing privacy concerns, ongoing investigations, and national security.

## Other Republicans Break Ranks

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene [called Trump's handling of the files a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation). Some Republican senators have expressed concern about political fallout from names appearing in the documents.

Massie did not specify what actions Bondi could take to restore his confidence or whether he would support efforts to remove her from office.
