## Ranch Background

The Zorro Ranch property has been the subject of [multiple law enforcement investigations](/news/2026-02-20-new-mexico-reopens-zorro-ranch-investigation-after-fbi-search-gap-revealed) since Epstein's July 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The [New Mexico Attorney General previously opened a criminal probe](/news/2026-02-19-new-mexico-ag-opens-criminal-probe-into-bodies-buried-at-epstein-ranch) into burial claims at the ranch.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting trial in a Manhattan federal jail. His associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges related to sex trafficking of minors.

The isolated New Mexico property became a focal point for investigators examining Epstein's alleged criminal network. The ranch was one of several properties Epstein owned, including residences in Manhattan, Palm Beach, and a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Law enforcement agencies have conducted searches and interviews related to activities at the ranch during Epstein's ownership. The property's remote location and limited public access have sustained investigative interest from multiple agencies.

The current Department of Justice investigation represents ongoing law enforcement activity connected to the property years after Epstein's death.
