**New Zealand's parliament** has voted to support removing **Prince Andrew** from the British royal line of succession, citing his connections to convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to BBC News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor** remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his military titles and royal patronages by Queen Elizabeth II in January 2022.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He ceased using the style "His Royal Highness" in official capacity, but his succession position remained unchanged under British constitutional law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

New Zealand's vote represents a formal call from a Commonwealth realm for the prince's removal from the line of succession.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> However, the parliamentary motion does not itself change Andrew's succession position, as such a change would require coordinated action by the UK Parliament and all Commonwealth realm governments.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Andrew's Epstein Ties and Legal Settlement

Andrew maintained contact with Epstein after the financier's 2008 conviction on state charges of soliciting a minor, including a visit to Epstein's New York mansion in 2010.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Virginia Giuffre** alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein and **Ghislaine Maxwell** and was forced to have sexual encounters with Andrew when she was 17 years old.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Andrew has consistently denied the allegations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

In 2022, Andrew settled a civil lawsuit filed by Giuffre in U.S. federal court.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The settlement included no admission of liability.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

In the UK, [the government has deferred decisions on potential inquiries into Andrew to parliamentary bodies](/news/2026-02-23-uk-government-defers-prince-andrew-epstein-inquiry-to-parliament).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Commonwealth Succession Law

Under the **Statute of Westminster 1931** and subsequent agreements, changes to the line of succession require the consent of all Commonwealth realms where the British monarch serves as head of state.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The **2013 Succession to the Crown Act** altered succession rules to end male primogeniture and remove restrictions on heirs marrying Catholics.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> That reform required parallel legislation in all 16 Commonwealth realms.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> New Zealand passed corresponding legislation to implement those changes.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Removing someone from the line of succession would require primary legislation in the UK Parliament and coordinated action across all Commonwealth realms.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The last time someone was removed from the succession by act of Parliament was under the **Act of Settlement 1701**, which barred Catholics and those married to Catholics from inheriting the throne—a provision partially repealed by the 2013 succession reforms.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Andrew's position as eighth in line places him behind King Charles III's direct descendants.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> As younger generations of the royal family have children, Andrew's position continues to move further from the throne.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
