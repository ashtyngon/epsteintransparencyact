House Republicans secured closed-door testimony from **former President Bill Clinton** and **former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton** before the **House Oversight and Government Reform Committee** regarding Jeffrey Epstein this week, but Democrats warned the move will backfire when they regain control of Congress.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Bill Clinton was deposed** about his relationship with Epstein, according to FOX Carolina.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The testimony follows the [subpoena issued to Hillary Clinton](/news/2026-02-26-hillary-clinton-subpoenaed-for-closed-door-epstein-testimony) in late February and Bill Clinton's [scheduled deposition](/news/2026-02-27-bill-clinton-scheduled-for-deposition-in-epstein-probe) days before the hearing.

## Democratic Response to GOP Subpoenas

Democrats characterized the Republican-led hearings as a political victory for the GOP but cautioned that the precedent will allow future Democratic majorities to issue similar subpoenas.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Hill reported that Democrats are "already warning that the extraordinary development will boomerang on the GOP whenever Democrats win back the House."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The depositions represent the first time both Clintons have been compelled to testify before Congress about their connections to Epstein. Bill Clinton previously provided testimony analyzed in a [February report](/news/2026-02-28-bill-clinton-s-epstein-testimony-analysis-and-skepticism) that documented skepticism about his statements regarding the disgraced financier.

## Broader Epstein Investigation Context

The Clinton depositions occur as the Epstein case continues to generate congressional scrutiny and international investigations. **Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.)** stated in late February that [more names will emerge from Epstein files](/news/2026-02-28-rep-ro-khanna-more-names-will-emerge-from-epstein-files), while [nine investigations launched overseas](/news/2026-02-28-nine-epstein-investigations-launch-overseas-while-u-s-probes-stall) as U.S. probes faced delays.

**Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.)** said in February that [Epstein files reveal a "much bigger" criminal network](/news/2026-02-24-rep-mace-epstein-files-reveal-much-bigger-criminal-network) than previously understood. The FBI has begun reviewing Epstein-related records under the Epstein Transparency Act, which was [signed into law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) after bipartisan congressional support.

The House Oversight Committee has not announced additional scheduled hearings related to the Epstein investigation.
