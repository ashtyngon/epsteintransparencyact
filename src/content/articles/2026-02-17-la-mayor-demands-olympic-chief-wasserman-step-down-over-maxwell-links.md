**Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass** has called for the resignation of **Casey Wasserman**, chairman of the 2028 Olympic Games organizing committee, following revelations in Department of Justice files documenting his communications with **Ghislaine Maxwell**, according to The Independent.

Bass made the demand after emails surfaced showing contact between Wasserman and Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker who facilitated **Jeffrey Epstein's** abuse network. Wasserman has denied having a personal or business relationship with Epstein, but the mayor's public call marks the first major political figure in Los Angeles to demand his removal from the Olympic leadership position.

The development comes as former Secretary of State **Hillary Clinton** accused the Trump administration of conducting an Epstein "cover-up" while President Trump claimed he had been "totally exonerated" in the files, according to separate reporting by The Independent.

## Olympic Leadership Under Fire

Wasserman [previously stepped down](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) from his sports and entertainment agency after the Maxwell email revelations surfaced. The agency sale followed his departure as an [Olympic organizing committee leader](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations), which documented hundreds of contacts between Wasserman's circle and Epstein's operation.

Mayor Bass's statement represents the first direct political pressure from Los Angeles civic leadership to remove Wasserman from his remaining Olympic role. The 2028 Los Angeles Games organizing committee has not yet responded publicly to the mayor's demand.

The Maxwell emails showed communications that placed Wasserman within Epstein's professional network during the years when Epstein was a registered sex offender. The Justice Department files did not specify the content or nature of the Maxwell-Wasserman communications.

## Clinton Alleges 'Cover-Up' as Trump Claims Exoneration

Clinton told the BBC that the Trump Justice Department was engaged in a "cover-up" of Epstein records, according to The Independent. The Justice Department has stated it released all Epstein records in compliance with the **Epstein Transparency Act**, signed into law in **2025**.

Trump responded to the files release by stating he had "nothing to hide" and claimed he had been "totally exonerated" in the documents, according to Open Magazine. The president reiterated his denials of any improper connection to Epstein.

The conflicting statements come after **Attorney General Pam Bondi** [listed 300 names](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release) in a February 15 letter to Congress, which lawmakers criticized for including dead celebrities and "mudding" the release with names of people who had no alleged wrongdoing.

Clinton's accusations align with criticism from multiple lawmakers who have questioned whether the Justice Department released complete files. **Representative Ro Khanna** demanded the DOJ "stop protecting predators" after examining redacted portions of the release. **Representative Nancy Mace** accused the DOJ of hiding names and later demanded unredacted co-conspirator files.

## Congressional Access to Unredacted Files

Members of Congress from Minnesota and Iowa are evaluating whether to review unredacted Epstein files available to lawmakers, according to KTTC reporting. The Justice Department has made complete files available to members of Congress in secure settings, but public releases remain heavily redacted.

**Representative Thomas Massie** of Kentucky declared "I am not suicidal" as he increased pressure for full transparency. Massie ripped the Trump DOJ over file redactions and said Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors during a congressional hearing. He later stated he had lost confidence in Bondi over the files dispute.

**Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene** also criticized Trump's handling of the files as a "political miscalculation" and faced death threats after her public statements.

The contrasting approaches between congressional Republicans who have criticized the release and Trump's assertions of exoneration highlight internal GOP tensions over the files.

## Trump Defense: Two Decades of Exposure

A columnist for Vision Times argued that Trump spent two decades exposing Epstein crimes, presenting a defense of the president's relationship with the convicted sex offender. Trump has consistently stated that he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago and provided information to prosecutors in prior Epstein investigations.

Flight logs and social photographs document Trump's presence at events where Epstein appeared during the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump has characterized these as business and social interactions that ended before Epstein's 2008 conviction.

The Justice Department files released in February 2026 included references to Trump but did not contain allegations of criminal conduct by the president. Several emails showed Epstein mentioning Trump in correspondence with associates.

## Pattern of Resignations and Investigations

Wasserman's situation follows a pattern of high-profile departures after names surfaced in DOJ files. **Goldman Sachs top lawyer** resigned after being named. The **Dubai Ports chief** resigned after hundreds of secret emails emerged. **Sarah Ferguson** shut down six companies after Epstein ties were exposed.

**Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's** Epstein ties have become a GOP liability, with GOP senators viewing his contacts as a political liability.

Congress has issued subpoenas to multiple figures, including Peter Mandelson and Les Wexner.

## International Investigations Expand

The files have triggered international action. France set up a special team to review the files for French nationals. French prosecutors launched an investigation into a diplomat. UK police launched a national task force for trafficking allegations, with the UK's top prosecutor stating "nobody above law" as police probe **Prince Andrew**.

New Mexico launched the first full investigation into Epstein's **Zorro Ranch**, the New Mexico property where abuse allegedly occurred. The ranch was purchased by the family of Texas GOP comptroller candidate Don Huffines for **$13.4 million**, causing alarm among Texas GOP leadership.

UN experts called for investigation into the files and warned of potential crimes against humanity.

## Scope of Release Disputed

A study showed the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files, contradicting Bondi's claim that the department released "all" files. The FBI explained why files remain heavily redacted, citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.

An expert warned that raw file releases could harm ongoing investigations. Bondi defended the complete file release as lawmakers demanded more transparency.

The release has spawned new investigative tools. JeffTube, a new platform, makes DOJ Epstein files easier to browse. The NYT launched a major investigation into millions of files.

The Justice Department maintains it has complied with the Epstein Transparency Act. Congressional hearings on the scope and completeness of the release continue. Bondi is scheduled to testify again before the House Judiciary Committee on the matter, though no date has been announced.
