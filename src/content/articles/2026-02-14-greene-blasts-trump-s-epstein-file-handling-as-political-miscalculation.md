Former **Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** (R-GA) called the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files his "biggest political miscalculation," according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Greene made the remarks on former InfoWars host **Owen Shroyer's** podcast on Friday, February 14.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She stated on a Saturday episode of the "Home of the Brave" podcast that Trump fought "the hardest" against the files' release and said he only signed the **Epstein Transparency Act** into law "because he had to."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"Thomas Massie, myself, Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, actually had to vote with all of the Democrats" to get the files released, Greene said, referencing the **discharge petition** that forced the bill to the House floor after committee leaders blocked it.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The bill passed **427 to 1**.

Greene also told fellow conservatives they sound like "cult fools" when defending the administration's handling of the files, adding: "Good luck trying to get women to vote for you."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Greene's Break With Trump

Greene, a former Trump ally, broke with the president when she signed the Epstein files discharge petition on **September 2, 2025** -- a decision that [led to Trump publicly attacking her](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) and withdrawing his endorsement, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Her remarks follow her earlier statement that Trump's MAGA slogan was "all a lie," saying his first year back in office focused on obliging wealthy supporters, big corporations, and pursuing foreign wars rather than delivering accountability.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Greene [resigned from Congress in January 2026](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) after losing the support of both party leadership and the president.

## Bondi and the DOJ

Greene stated that **Attorney General Pam Bondi** is still operating under the president's direction when it comes to the files and the DOJ's handling of potential criminal referrals.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> [Bondi was questioned during congressional testimony](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) about why the DOJ has kept files heavily redacted and was accused of monitoring Democratic lawmakers' searches of the files.

Since the files began emerging, Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned after being named in documents. Casey Wasserman announced plans to sell his talent agency following the publication of emails with **Ghislaine Maxwell**. Congress issued subpoenas to billionaire **Les Wexner** and former EU trade commissioner **Peter Mandelson** to testify about their documented contacts with Epstein.

Greene's public criticism adds to bipartisan pressure on the Trump administration over the pace and completeness of the file releases mandated by the Epstein Transparency Act.
