Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files "his biggest political miscalculation," marking a rare public break with the president by one of his most consistent allies.

The Georgia congresswoman did not specify what actions she wants the administration to take differently. Her criticism comes as Trump has [called for an end to the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) and his Justice Department faces accusations of [covering up files through excessive redactions](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions).

## Files Trigger Wave of Resignations

Since the files began emerging, multiple executives have stepped down. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in documents. [Casey Wasserman sold his talent agency](/articles/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-talent-agency-after-ghislaine-maxwell-emails-exposed) following exposure of emails with Ghislaine Maxwell.

Congress has issued subpoenas to billionaire Les Wexner and former EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson to testify about their Epstein connections.

## Administration Under Scrutiny

Attorney General Pam Bondi defended keeping files heavily redacted during congressional testimony. She was previously caught monitoring Democratic lawmakers' searches of Epstein files.

Greene has pushed for greater transparency on the files and supported congressional investigations into Epstein's network.
