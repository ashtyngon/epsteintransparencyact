An Emirati billionaire has resigned as CEO of a logistics company following Epstein revelations, ABC7 Los Angeles reported. The description matches [DP World Chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails), whose departure this outlet has already covered in detail.

## Same Story, Wider Coverage

DP World, a Dubai-based ports and logistics giant, [forced out Bin Sulayem](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties) after emails surfaced in newly released Epstein files showing connections to the financier's network. The billionaire executive's exit marks one of the most significant corporate casualties of the document releases.

Bin Sulayem's resignation followed [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepping down](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-secret-epstein-ties-revealed-in-emails) after being named in the files. Both departures happened within days of each other as the Epstein Transparency Act forced the release of millions of pages of previously sealed records.

## Why Logistics Matters

Epstein's operation required moving people and resources across international borders without scrutiny. Logistics companies — particularly those operating ports and freight networks — provided infrastructure that could facilitate such movement. The files have exposed business relationships that span continents and involve billions in trade.

Gulf state business elites maintain deep ties to Western financial and political power centers. Those relationships are now facing public examination for the first time.

## The Pressure Builds

Each document release triggers a familiar pattern: names surface, pressure mounts, executives exit. [Congress has subpoenaed billionaire Les Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify under oath about his decades-long relationship with Epstein. The [New York Times launched a major investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into the millions of pages now public.

Not everyone welcomes the scrutiny. [President Trump called for an end to the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation), calling it a "distraction." The Justice Department faces [accusations of cover-up efforts](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) through excessive redactions.

The House Judiciary Committee [grilled Attorney General Pam Bondi](/articles/2026-02-13-house-judiciary-grills-ag-over-growing-epstein-connections) over the pace and completeness of disclosures. A separate controversy emerged when documents revealed [DOJ has been tracking which lawmakers search the Epstein files](/articles/2026-02-13-doj-tracking-lawmaker-epstein-file-searches-bondi-document-reveals).

More document dumps are scheduled. Each one brings new names and new questions about who enabled Epstein's operation across multiple continents.
