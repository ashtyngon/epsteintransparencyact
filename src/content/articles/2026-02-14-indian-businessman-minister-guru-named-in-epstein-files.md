Three prominent Indians appear in Epstein documents released under the transparency act, The News Minute reported: Subrata Roy, founder of the Sahara Group conglomerate; Kapil Sibal, a former Union Minister; and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, founder of the Art of Living Foundation.

The News Minute's report places each figure in contact with Epstein during the years when his network spanned multiple continents.

## The Businessman

Subrata Roy built Sahara Group into one of India's largest conglomerates. The Supreme Court of India sentenced him to jail in 2014 for contempt after his company failed to refund billions to investors. Roy died in 2023.

According to The News Minute, records show Roy and Epstein had direct contact.

## The Minister

Kapil Sibal served as Union Minister under the United Progressive Alliance government in multiple portfolios, including Telecom, Law and Justice, and Human Resource Development. He left the Congress party in 2022 and now sits in the Rajya Sabha.

The News Minute reports the documents name Sibal in connection with Epstein's network during his cabinet tenure. Sibal has not issued a public statement.

## The Spiritual Leader

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar founded the Art of Living Foundation in 1981. The organization claims a presence in over 150 countries. Ravi Shankar has advised multiple Indian governments and maintains relationships with political leaders across party lines.

The News Minute reports his name surfaces in the Epstein files alongside correspondence and contact information.

## Global Network

The Indian names join international figures documented in Epstein's circle. [Congressional subpoenas have targeted UK businessman Peter Mandelson](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe), and [Dubai's DP World chairman resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties) after hundreds of emails emerged.

[The FBI maintains thousands of files still under review](/articles/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the transparency law passed this year. Each document release has named additional figures who intersected with Epstein's operations between his 2008 conviction and his 2019 death.

None of the three Indian figures has responded publicly.
