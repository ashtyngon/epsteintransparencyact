**Les Wexner**, the 88-year-old billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret, told House Oversight Committee investigators on Wednesday that he was "duped by a world-class con man" in his decades-long relationship with **Jeffrey Epstein**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The closed-door deposition, held in New Albany, Ohio where Wexner lives, marked the first time the billionaire has testified under oath about his ties to Epstein since the Justice Department named him as a "co-conspirator" in released Epstein files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Wexner has not been charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> In a statement released ahead of the deposition, he described himself as an "ethical man, philanthropist and community builder."<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

House Democrats who participated in the deposition expressed frustration with Wexner's testimony, saying he provided few new details about his relationship with Epstein and showed little remorse.

## Democrats Say Wexner "Denied Everything"

**Rep. Robert Garcia** (D-Calif.), the Oversight Committee's top Democrat, told reporters midway through the deposition that Wexner "denied everything, and quite frankly, it would have been nice to see more remorse."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Garcia spoke to reporters during a break in the closed-door session, which Democrats said was led by committee staff.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Democratic members said Wexner's testimony raised more questions than it answered.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The deposition focused on Wexner's decades-long association with Epstein, who served as his financial adviser for years before their relationship ended in 2007.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Wexner has spent years responding to questions about his prominent friendship with Epstein, one of the most well-documented relationships in the convicted sex offender's network of wealthy associates.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## No Republicans Attended In Person

None of the Oversight Committee's Republican members were physically present at the Ohio deposition.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Democrats noted this absence in their remarks to reporters following the session.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

A source familiar with the matter pointed out that Democrats did not attend depositions of Bill and Hillary Clinton that were scheduled on Capitol Hill in January.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> **Chairman James Comer** (R-Ky.) was absent from the Wexner deposition due to what Axios reported as a "maj," with the sentence appearing incomplete in the published report.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The partisan split over attendance mirrors broader tensions within the committee's investigation into the Epstein files, which were released by the Justice Department earlier this year under the Epstein Transparency Act.

## Wexner's "Co-Conspirator" Designation

The Justice Department's release of Epstein files identified Wexner as a "co-conspirator," a designation that has drawn intense scrutiny to the billionaire's past relationship with Epstein.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The files document extensive financial and personal ties between the two men spanning multiple decades.

Wexner granted Epstein sweeping power of attorney over his financial affairs, an arrangement that ended in 2007 when Epstein's criminal conduct first became public.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Epstein managed Wexner's personal finances and had access to multiple properties owned by the billionaire, including a Manhattan townhouse that Wexner later transferred to Epstein.

The relationship between Wexner and Epstein has been central to understanding how the financier built his wealth and cultivated relationships with other prominent figures. Wexner is widely regarded as Epstein's most significant and longest-standing client.

## School Photo Company Faces Backlash Over Black Connection

In a separate development Wednesday, school districts across the country began cutting ties with **Lifetouch**, a major school photography company, after social media posts highlighted alleged connections between its parent company and Epstein associate **Leon Black**.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

The posts pointed to a link between the photography giant and Black, a billionaire who appears in the Epstein files.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> School districts are now reconsidering their partnerships with Lifetouch in response to public pressure stemming from the Epstein files release.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

The Lifetouch controversy illustrates how the Justice Department's release of Epstein files continues to create business and reputational consequences for individuals and companies with documented ties to Epstein's network, even when no criminal charges have been filed.

## Former Texas Senator Plans Christian Retreat at Epstein's Ranch

Former Texas state Sen. **Don Huffines** (R), who purchased the New Mexico ranch previously owned by Epstein, told former Rep. **Matt Gaetz** (R-Fla.) on Tuesday that he plans to convert the property into a Christian retreat.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Huffines, currently running for Texas comptroller, made the announcement during an appearance on Gaetz's One America News Network show.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

The **Zorro Ranch** property in New Mexico has been the subject of intense public interest since Epstein's arrest and death. Huffines's purchase of the property and his stated plans for its future represent one of the most concrete steps taken to repurpose assets formerly owned by Epstein.

New Mexico authorities launched the [first full investigation into Zorro Ranch](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) earlier this week, examining Epstein's activities at the remote property during the years he owned it.

## Broader Fallout From File Release

The Wexner deposition comes as multiple investigations and inquiries continue in response to the Justice Department's release of Epstein files. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) has [demanded that the CIA release its Epstein-related documents](/news/2026-02-18-rep-mace-demands-cia-release-epstein-documents), arguing that the intelligence agency has not complied with disclosure requirements under the Epstein Transparency Act.

[Twelve prominent figures resigned from various positions](/news/2026-02-17-full-list-of-politicians-royals-named-in-epstein-files-released) after being named in the files, including [billionaire Thomas Pritzker, who stepped down from his role at Hyatt](/news/2026-02-17-hyatt-billionaire-thomas-pritzker-resigns-over-epstein-ties). [French prosecutors launched two separate Epstein probes](/news/2026-02-18-french-prosecutors-launch-two-epstein-probes-call-for-victim-complaints) and called for victim complaints, while [European police opened new investigations](/news/2026-02-18-epstein-files-revelations-spark-new-european-police-probes) based on revelations in the files.

The House Oversight Committee has not announced whether it plans additional depositions following Wexner's testimony. Democrats on the committee indicated they were dissatisfied with the information provided and suggested further investigation may be warranted, though no specific next steps were announced Wednesday.
