A member of the British royal family was arrested this week in the United Kingdom on suspicion of misconduct in public office related to communications with Jeffrey Epstein, marking the first arrest of a royal family member in the U.K. since 1647, The Guardian reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Guardian columnist Rebecca Solnit wrote that "the outcry and activism of the 2010s – itself enabled by earlier generations of feminists – brought us to this moment."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Public outrage in the United States about Epstein forced the government to release files that included emails between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein now under investigation in the criminal case, according to Solnit.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Trade Secrets, Not Sex Charges

The charges relate to trade-related communications with Epstein and allegations that Andrew leaked state secrets to him, not to allegations of sexual wrongdoing, The Guardian reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Emails between Andrew and Epstein are now under investigation in the criminal case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Virginia Giuffre accused Andrew of having sex with her when she was a minor being trafficked by Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Andrew has always denied wrongdoing, according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Until his arrest, only his family had held him accountable for his ongoing association with Epstein, Solnit wrote.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Feminist Movement's Role in Transparency Push

Solnit's column argues that decades of feminist organizing created the conditions that led to the document release and subsequent arrest. "The outcry and activism of the 2010s – itself enabled by earlier generations of feminists – brought us to this moment," she wrote.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

She also warned that "if the Trump administration has its way, opposing forces will prevail."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which passed the Senate unanimously in December 2024, requires declassification and public release of records related to Epstein held by federal agencies.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The [FBI began its review of Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the new law in January 2025.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>
