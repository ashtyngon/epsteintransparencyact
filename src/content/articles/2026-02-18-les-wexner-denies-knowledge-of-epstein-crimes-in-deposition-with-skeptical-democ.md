Billionaire retail mogul Les Wexner denied firsthand knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activity in a deposition with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, garnering skepticism from Democratic members.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner, who employed Epstein as a financial manager through the 1990s and early 2000s, told the panel he was conned by Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The testimony marks the latest development in the committee's ongoing investigation into Epstein's network of associates and the extent to which individuals in his orbit knew about or facilitated his criminal activity.

## Democratic Lawmakers Question Account

Democratic committee members expressed doubt about Wexner's claims during the deposition.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The skepticism focused on Wexner's assertion that he had no knowledge of Epstein's conduct despite their decades-long business relationship.

The L Brands founder granted Epstein extensive control over his personal finances and business affairs during their relationship, which lasted more than a decade. Epstein managed Wexner's fortune and acquired his Manhattan mansion from the retail executive in the 1990s.

## Wexner's History With Epstein

Wexner has previously stated he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after discovering financial irregularities. That separation came before Epstein's 2008 conviction on state prostitution charges in Florida, for which he served 13 months in a work-release program under a controversial plea agreement with federal prosecutors.

Epstein was arrested again in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges and died in his Manhattan jail cell one month later in what was ruled a suicide. His death came weeks after his arrest and before he could stand trial.

## Broader Congressional Probe

The House Oversight Committee [subpoenaed Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) as part of its examination of how Epstein operated for years despite multiple allegations against him. The investigation has sought to identify individuals who may have enabled or had knowledge of Epstein's criminal enterprise.

Wexner's name appeared unredacted in documents unsealed in January as part of court-ordered releases in civil litigation related to Epstein. Those files included depositions from alleged victims and witnesses describing Epstein's activities and associates.

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in 2025, requires federal agencies to review and release government documents related to Epstein's activities and associates. The FBI confirmed it is processing records under the law for potential public release.
