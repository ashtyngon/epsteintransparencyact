New Mexico prosecutors have reopened a criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's Zorro Ranch, according to the state attorney general's office.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The investigation was initially closed in 2019, but officials now say new revelations "warrant further examination."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The attorney general's office did not specify what information prompted the decision to reopen the case or whether any individuals are targets of the inquiry.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Zorro Ranch is a remote property in New Mexico that Epstein owned for years before his August 2019 death in federal custody. Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges at the time of his death, which a medical examiner ruled a suicide.

## Previous Investigation

New Mexico authorities first investigated the ranch property in 2019 following Epstein's death. That investigation was subsequently closed without criminal charges being filed related to activities at the property.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The attorney general's office has not provided a timeline for the reopened investigation or indicated whether investigators plan to conduct additional searches of the property.

The decision to reopen the inquiry comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Epstein's network of properties and associates. Federal authorities released thousands of pages of previously sealed documents under the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law in January 2026.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.
