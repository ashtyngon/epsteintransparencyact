**Hillary Clinton** is scheduled to testify Thursday before the House Oversight Committee regarding connections to **Jeffrey Epstein**, with **Bill Clinton** set to appear Friday, according to multiple news reports.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The depositions mark the first time either Clinton has provided sworn testimony to Congress about their relationship with the late financier.

The questioning will take place behind closed doors as part of an ongoing congressional investigation into Epstein's network of associates and alleged co-conspirators.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The House Oversight Committee has not publicly disclosed the specific scope of questions the former secretary of state and senator will face during her testimony.

Bill Clinton's appearance is scheduled for Friday, one day after his wife's deposition.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The timing of both testimonies comes more than five years after Epstein's death in federal custody and follows the recent implementation of transparency legislation requiring disclosure of government records related to the case.

## Congressional Investigation Into Epstein Associates

The House Oversight Committee probe represents Congress's effort to examine the full extent of Epstein's connections to prominent figures in politics, business, and other fields. The committee has authority to compel testimony from individuals who had documented contact with Epstein or visited his properties.

Bill Clinton's past association with Epstein has been documented through flight logs showing the former president traveled on Epstein's private aircraft on multiple occasions. The nature and frequency of these interactions have been subjects of public scrutiny, though Clinton has previously denied knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities.

The closed-door format of the depositions means transcripts may not be immediately available to the public, depending on committee rules and any classification decisions. Congressional investigators typically use private sessions to ask detailed questions before determining whether to hold public hearings on their findings.

## Political Context of the Testimonies

The Washington Post characterized the development as a shift in focus after years of speculation, noting that former President **Donald Trump** had "stirred rumors for years" before attention turned to the Clintons' testimony about Epstein.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Trump himself was photographed with Epstein at various social events in the 1990s and early 2000s, though he has stated he was "not a fan" of Epstein and banned him from his Mar-a-Lago club.

The House Oversight Committee has not announced whether it will seek testimony from other prominent individuals connected to Epstein. The committee's investigation operates separately from ongoing civil litigation involving Epstein's estate and from any potential criminal investigations by the Department of Justice.

Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** said Wednesday he was hoping for "productive" conversations regarding separate diplomatic talks with Iran, though his comments were not directly related to the Epstein investigation.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The coinciding timing of various government activities has created a busy news cycle for the administration.

## Background on Epstein Case

Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges of soliciting a minor under a controversial plea agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution at that time.

**Ghislaine Maxwell**, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Her trial revealed extensive details about Epstein's recruitment and abuse of underage girls over multiple decades.

The Epstein Transparency Act, which became law in 2025, requires federal agencies to review and disclose documents related to Epstein's activities and associations, subject to certain redactions for national security and privacy concerns. The law has prompted new releases of FBI files and other government records that were previously withheld.
