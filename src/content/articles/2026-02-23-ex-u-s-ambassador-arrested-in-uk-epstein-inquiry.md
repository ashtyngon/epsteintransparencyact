British authorities have arrested **Louis B. Susman**, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, on suspicion of misconduct related to his connections with convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to **NPR**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Susman served as U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St James's from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> British police arrested him on suspicion of misconduct in public office, NPR reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The charge typically applies to public officials who abuse their position or fail to perform their duties properly.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Ambassador's Background

Susman, a Democratic fundraiser and former vice chairman of investment bank Citigroup, was appointed to the ambassadorship after a long career in finance and politics.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His tenure in London overlapped with Epstein's activities following the financier's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Susman concluded his ambassadorship in 2013, more than a decade before his arrest.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, serving ambassadors enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution in their host countries, though that immunity typically expires when their diplomatic mission ends.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Expanding U.K. Investigation

The arrest comes amid an expanding British investigation into Epstein's associates and their activities in the United Kingdom.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> British authorities have [investigated multiple high-profile figures](/news/2026-02-23-peter-mandelson-arrested-in-uk-epstein-investigation) with connections to Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein maintained properties and business interests in London and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He died in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

His associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Multiple government officials, business leaders, and members of high society have faced questions about their relationships with Epstein, particularly regarding meetings and interactions that occurred after his 2008 conviction.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in 2025, mandates declassification of government records related to Epstein's activities and associations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
