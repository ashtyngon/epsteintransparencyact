An Epstein abuse survivor publicly criticized the Department of Justice for withholding records related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, calling the agency "no better" than Epstein himself, NBC New York reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The survivor demanded immediate action, stating "release the damn files," in a direct rebuke of the Justice Department's handling of Epstein-related records.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The statement equated the DOJ's conduct with that of the convicted sex offender, saying the department is "no better" than Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Transparency Act Document Releases

The criticism comes as federal agencies continue reviewing and releasing documents under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), signed into law in January 2025. The law requires federal agencies to declassify and publicly release records related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates, with limited exceptions for national security and ongoing investigations.

The Department of Justice oversees the FBI's review process mandated by the legislation. Initial document releases began in February 2025, revealing thousands of pages of emails, flight logs, and investigative records.

Multiple survivors and advocates have called for full disclosure of government records related to Epstein's network. Some lawmakers have questioned whether agencies are complying fully with the transparency law's requirements.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) has stated that [Epstein files reveal a criminal network](/news/2026-02-24-rep-mace-epstein-files-reveal-much-bigger-criminal-network) extending beyond what was previously understood. Other members of Congress have raised concerns about potential withholding of records by executive branch agencies.

## Epstein Case Background

Jeffrey Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor under a controversial plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida. He faced renewed federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 but died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial.

His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The survivor's statement to NBC New York represents one of the strongest public criticisms yet directed at the Justice Department over its handling of records under the transparency law. By equating the DOJ's conduct with Epstein's own actions, the survivor's remarks underscore the depth of frustration among victims seeking accountability and full disclosure.
