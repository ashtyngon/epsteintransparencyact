**Tom Pritzker**, executive chairman of the **Hyatt Hotels Corporation** and scion of one of America's wealthiest families, stepped down from his position on **February 16, 2026**, after documents showed he maintained regular contact with convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to the New York Times. The resignation marks the latest in a series of high-profile departures triggered by the ongoing release of Epstein-related files.

Pritzker's exit comes as newly released documents reveal extensive communication between the billionaire and Epstein. The nature and content of those communications remain unclear from publicly available files.

The Pritzker family controls a business empire spanning hotels, manufacturing, and private equity, with an estimated net worth exceeding $30 billion. Tom Pritzker served as executive chairman of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, a publicly traded company founded by his family in 1957.

## Bannon Maintained "Chummy" Relationship Despite Epstein's Conviction

**Steve Bannon**, the MAGA podcaster and former White House chief strategist, developed what the New York Times described as a "seemingly chummy relationship" with Epstein after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Text messages released in recent document dumps show Bannon maintained contact with the financier despite his status as a registered sex offender.

Bannon has stated he cultivated the relationship to get Epstein to "open up," according to the Times report. The nature of what information Bannon sought from Epstein was not specified in the released documents.

The revelation adds to previous reporting that [Bannon discussed "taking down" Pope Francis with Epstein](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files), according to DOJ files released last week.

## DOJ Continues to Withhold Documents Despite Federal Law

Representative **Thomas Massie** told The American Conservative that the Department of Justice continues withholding Epstein documents despite the federal Epstein Transparency Act mandating their release. Massie's statement, published February 16, directly contradicts Attorney General **Pam Bondi's** assertion that the DOJ had released "all" Epstein files.

[Bondi told lawmakers she released complete files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed) in a February 16 statement. She provided a list of approximately 300 names included in the release.

The discrepancy between Massie's account and Bondi's claims follows a contentious February hearing where [Massie stated he had "lost confidence" in the Attorney General](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over her handling of the file release. [Previous analysis found the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows), according to a study published last week.

[Massie has publicly declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files issue. The Kentucky congressman has been among the most vocal critics of the administration's handling of the document release.

## British Lobbying System Under Scrutiny After Mandelson Emails

**Transparency International UK** released an analysis on February 16 examining what the **Peter Mandelson**-Epstein email exchanges reveal about Britain's lobbying regulations. The report questioned how a registered sex offender maintained access to high-level British politicians and policymakers without triggering oversight mechanisms.

[Congress subpoenaed Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) on February 13 to testify about his relationship with Epstein. The former European Union trade commissioner and British cabinet minister has not publicly commented on the subpoena or the content of the emails.

The Transparency International report highlighted gaps in the UK's lobbying disclosure requirements that allowed Epstein's contacts with British officials to remain undisclosed for years. The organization called for reforms to Britain's lobbying registration system.

## Global Investigations Expand Beyond U.S. Borders

Multiple countries have launched formal investigations into Epstein's connections within their jurisdictions, according to a February 16 report in The Independent. The investigations span at least six countries across Europe and Asia.

[France established a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) on February 14.

[The United Kingdom launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) on February 14 to handle trafficking allegations emerging from the files.

[Indian officials including a businessman, minister, and spiritual guru were named](/news/2026-02-14-indian-businessman-minister-guru-named-in-epstein-files) in the files, according to February 14 reports. The Indian government has not announced whether it will conduct investigations.

## Document Volume Comparison to Other Major Leaks

The Epstein files, while extensive, remain smaller in total volume than the Pandora Papers, Panama Papers, and Paradise Papers leaks, according to an analysis published February 16 in The Sunday Guardian. The report noted the Epstein release contains approximately 2-3 terabytes of data, compared to the Panama Papers' 2.6 terabytes and the Pandora Papers' 2.94 terabytes.

However, the Sunday Guardian analysis found the Epstein files' significance lies not in volume but in the specificity of communications and the prominence of individuals named. The documents include emails, flight logs, calendars, and financial records spanning more than two decades.

[A new platform called JeffTube](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse) launched on February 16 to make the DOJ files easier to browse and search. The platform allows users to search by name, date, or keyword across the released documents.

## Pattern of Elite Resignations Continues

Pritzker's resignation continues a pattern of departures among corporate and political figures named in the files. Recent exits include:

[**Casey Wasserman** sold his sports marketing agency](/news/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-agency-after-epstein-files-expose-ties) after files exposed his ties to Epstein. Wasserman also [stepped down as Olympic organizing committee chief](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) after **Ghislaine Maxwell** email revelations.
