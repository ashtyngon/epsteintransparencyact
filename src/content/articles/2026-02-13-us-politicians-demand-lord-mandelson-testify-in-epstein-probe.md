U.S. politicians are urging Lord Peter Mandelson to give evidence about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, according to BBC News.

The call for testimony comes as [congressional investigators pursue multiple high-profile figures](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) connected to the late financier's network. Mandelson has previously expressed regret for his continued association with Epstein.

## Mounting Pressure

The request for Mandelson's testimony follows weeks of congressional action targeting Epstein associates. Lawmakers have already [subpoenaed billionaire Les Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and [named six men on the House floor](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-on-house-floor) whose identities they claim have been obscured in document releases.

Multiple executives have resigned after their Epstein connections surfaced, including [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) and [several corporate chiefs](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails). But expressions of regret haven't satisfied investigators demanding sworn testimony.

## Pattern of Pressure

The move against Mandelson fits a broader strategy. Congressional committees have spent weeks [grilling Attorney General Pam Bondi](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) over [heavily redacted documents](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) and the slow pace of releases. Each new batch of files has exposed more names, generating more demands for testimony.

The question now is whether Mandelson will comply. His position as a senior diplomatic figure could complicate any potential appearance before U.S. lawmakers, but the public pressure continues to mount on anyone who maintained ties to Epstein.
