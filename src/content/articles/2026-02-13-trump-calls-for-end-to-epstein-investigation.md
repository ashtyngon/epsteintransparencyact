# Trump Says U.S. Should Move On From Epstein Investigation in CBS Interview

**President Donald Trump** stated the United States should move on from the **Jeffrey Epstein investigation** during an interview on CBS News' "The Takeout with Major Garrett" aired **February 12, 2026**. The comments mark Trump's most direct position on the ongoing Epstein files controversy since returning to office.

The statement comes as multiple investigations into Epstein's network remain active and public pressure continues for full transparency regarding the deceased financier's associates and activities. Trump's remarks may signal a shift in federal priorities regarding document releases and prosecutorial efforts connected to the case.

## Trump's Position on Epstein Files

According to CBS News, Trump told Major Garrett that the country should move forward rather than continue pursuing Epstein-related investigations. The interview did not specify whether this position extends to the release of sealed documents or ongoing criminal investigations into Epstein's alleged co-conspirators.

The **Epstein Transparency Act**, which passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously before being signed into law on November 19, 2025, mandated the release of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activities and associates. The DOJ has since released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos. Trump's comments suggest resistance to further transparency measures from the executive branch.

## Implications for Ongoing Investigations

Trump's statement raises questions about the future of federal investigations into Epstein's network. **Jeffrey Epstein** died on August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted on December 29, 2021 of sex trafficking minors and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. No additional co-conspirators have been charged.

Epstein's original 2008 plea deal, negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta with Epstein's defense team — which included Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr — has long been criticized for its leniency, resulting in just 13 months of county jail with work release privileges.

Multiple civil lawsuits against Epstein's estate and alleged associates remain pending. Several survivors have called for full disclosure of documents that could identify additional perpetrators and enablers in Epstein's trafficking operation. It remains unclear whether Trump's remarks represent official policy or personal opinion, and whether they will affect Justice Department priorities under Attorney General Pam Bondi.
