# Trump Says U.S. Should Move On From Epstein Investigation in CBS Interview

**President Donald Trump** stated the United States should move on from the **Jeffrey Epstein investigation** during an interview on CBS News' "The Takeout with Major Garrett" aired **February 12, 2026**. The comments mark Trump's most direct position on the ongoing Epstein files controversy since returning to office.

The statement comes as multiple investigations into Epstein's network remain active and public pressure continues for full transparency regarding the deceased financier's associates and activities. Trump's remarks may signal a shift in federal priorities regarding document releases and prosecutorial efforts connected to the case.

## Trump's Position on Epstein Files

According to CBS News, Trump told Major Garrett that the country should move forward rather than continue pursuing Epstein-related investigations. The interview did not specify whether this position extends to the release of sealed documents or ongoing criminal investigations into Epstein's alleged co-conspirators.

The **Epstein Transparency Act**, which aims to mandate release of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activities and associates, has gained congressional support but faces an uncertain path. Trump's comments suggest potential resistance to transparency measures from the executive branch.

## Implications for Ongoing Investigations

Trump's statement raises questions about the future of federal investigations into Epstein's network. **Jeffrey Epstein** died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Multiple civil lawsuits against Epstein's estate and alleged associates remain pending. Several survivors have called for full disclosure of documents that could identify additional perpetrators and enablers in Epstein's alleged trafficking operation.

It remains unclear whether Trump's remarks represent official policy or personal opinion, and whether they will affect Justice Department priorities or document declassification decisions.
