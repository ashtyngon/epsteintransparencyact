Jeffrey Epstein attempted to bring multiple women with him during a planned 2013 visit to SpaceX headquarters, The Mercury News reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Mercury News reported that Epstein sought to include an entourage of women on the tour of SpaceX facilities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The 2013 timeframe places the planned visit five years after Epstein's 2008 conviction on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Under the terms of that controversial plea agreement, Epstein served 13 months in a county jail with work-release privileges that allowed him to leave custody during the day.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The arrangement drew widespread criticism after details became public, with legal experts and victims' advocates calling it unusually lenient for the severity of the underlying conduct.

## Post-Conviction Access to Elite Circles

Following his 2008 conviction, Epstein continued to maintain high-profile social and business connections despite being a registered sex offender.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> His social calendar included meetings with prominent figures in technology, finance, and academia.

SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002 and by 2013 had emerged as a leading private spaceflight company.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> That year marked significant milestones for the company, including successful cargo missions to the International Space Station under NASA contracts.

Court documents and victim testimony from subsequent legal proceedings established that Epstein frequently traveled with young women and girls, often presenting them as assistants or associates.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Multiple victims described being transported to meetings with powerful individuals as part of what prosecutors later characterized as a sex trafficking operation.

## Federal Charges and Death

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors in Florida and New York.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The indictment alleged he sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his residences in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations.

He died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> His death prompted investigations into the Bureau of Prisons' handling of his detention and sparked conspiracy theories that persist to this day.

His former associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> She is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.

Flight logs, visitor records, and testimony from multiple sources have revealed extensive contact between Epstein and figures in technology, science, finance, and politics between his 2008 conviction and his 2019 arrest.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>
