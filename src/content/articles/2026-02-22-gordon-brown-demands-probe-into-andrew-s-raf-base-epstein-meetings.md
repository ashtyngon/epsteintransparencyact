Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for a police investigation into whether Prince Andrew used Royal Air Force bases to meet Jeffrey Epstein during Andrew's time as the United Kingdom's trade envoy, BBC News reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Brown demanded a full investigation into Andrew's role as UK trade envoy, according to BBC News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The former prime minister's statement specifically focuses on whether Andrew used RAF bases during meetings with Epstein while holding his government trade position.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Andrew served as the UK's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment from 2001 to 2011, a role that involved promoting British business interests abroad. Brown served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010, a period that overlapped with Andrew's tenure in the trade position.

## Current Investigation

The call from Brown comes as British police continue examining Andrew's connections to Epstein. [Authorities arrested Andrew and have conducted searches at his Royal Lodge residence](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-in-london-over-epstein-documents) in Windsor Great Park as part of their ongoing investigation.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Andrew's Trade Role

Andrew held the unpaid position of trade envoy for a decade, traveling extensively to represent British commercial interests. The position gave him access to diplomatic channels, government aircraft, and official facilities as part of his duties.

Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida. Andrew maintained contact with Epstein after the conviction, including a 2010 visit to Epstein's New York mansion that was photographed and later became a source of public controversy.

Andrew stepped down from the trade envoy role in 2011 following criticism of his friendship with Epstein and his business contacts. He withdrew from public duties entirely in 2019 after a BBC interview about his relationship with Epstein.
