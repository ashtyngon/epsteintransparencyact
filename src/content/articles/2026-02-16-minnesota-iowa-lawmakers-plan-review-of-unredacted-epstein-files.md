## Regional Lawmakers Silent on File Review

Federal lawmakers representing Minnesota and Iowa have not said whether they will review unredacted versions of the Epstein files, according to KTTC.

The station surveyed congressional delegations from both states following Attorney General Pam Bondi's release of what she described as a complete list of names from the Department of Justice's Epstein files. KTTC reported no affirmative responses from representatives of either state.

The lack of public commitment from Minnesota and Iowa delegations contrasts with lawmakers in other states who have announced plans to examine the documents.

## Congressional Access Under Transparency Act

The Epstein Transparency Act grants members of Congress authority to review unredacted files in a secure reading room. The process mirrors procedures used for classified intelligence briefings, where lawmakers examine sensitive documents without making them public.

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina have both committed to reviewing the unredacted files. Massie [lost confidence in Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) after she avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors during a congressional hearing.

Rep. Ro Khanna of California [accused the DOJ of "protecting predators"](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) by redacting portions of the files. Mace [demanded unredacted co-conspirator files](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files), calling the current release inadequate.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia [criticized Trump's handling of the files](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) as a "political miscalculation." She later [received death threats](/news/2026-02-17-greene-faces-death-threats-over-trump-epstein-files-dispute) over her public criticism.

## Dispute Over Release Completeness

Bondi [testified before Congress](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more) that the DOJ had released "all" files. Lawmakers from both parties disputed that claim.

The DOJ provided a list of approximately 300 names, including [deceased celebrities](/news/2026-02-15-bondi-named-dead-celebrities-in-epstein-email-list) such as David Bowie and Michael Jackson. Congress [accused Bondi of "mudding" the list](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) by including people with no alleged criminal involvement.

One independent analysis found the Trump DOJ [released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows). The FBI's Epstein file collection spans millions of pages.

Documents released so far show [Epstein maintained ties to elite institutions](/news/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama) and [received invitations to congressional events](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-invited-to-congressional-galas-years-after-arrest-docs-show) years after his initial conviction.

## International Investigations Expand

The United Kingdom [launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations. France [established a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review files for French nationals. New Mexico [opened its first full investigation](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) into Epstein's Zorro Ranch property.

A [Goldman Sachs lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in documents. The [Dubai ports chief stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails surfaced. [Hyatt heir Tom Pritzker](/news/2026-02-16-hyatt-heir-tom-pritzker-steps-down-over-epstein-contact-links) left his position over contact links revealed in the files.

United Nations experts [called for a formal investigation](/news/2026-02-16-un-experts-call-for-investigation-into-epstein-files-warn-of-crimes-against-huma), warning the case could involve crimes against humanity.
