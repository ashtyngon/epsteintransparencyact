School districts across the United States are reconsidering their partnerships with Lifetouch, the school photography company, after online posts highlighted connections between financier Leon Black and Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Black, a billionaire private equity executive who co-founded Apollo Global Management, had ties to Lifetouch's corporate family. Social media users circulated information about Black's past association with Epstein and his former ownership stake in Lifetouch's parent company.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Districts stated they were responding to concerns raised by parents and community members.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Black's Payments to Epstein

Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services between 2012 and 2017, according to a 2021 review commissioned by Apollo's board.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The payments occurred after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor.

Black stepped down as Apollo's chief executive in 2021 following the release of that review.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He has stated that his relationship with Epstein was strictly professional and related to tax advice.

In February 2026, [several school districts canceled photo day events](/news/2026-02-15-leon-black-named-in-epstein-files-schools-cancel-photo-day) after Black's name appeared in newly released Epstein files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Corporate Structure

Lifetouch was acquired by Shutterfly in 2018.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Apollo Global Management, the private equity firm Black co-founded, has had investment relationships with various photography and consumer companies.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The social media posts focused on historical connections between Black, Apollo, and companies in Lifetouch's corporate family.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Lifetouch is one of the largest school photography companies in North America, providing yearbook photos, class pictures, and portrait services to thousands of schools.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> School photography contracts typically involve multi-year agreements between districts and vendors, with services provided at no cost to schools in exchange for access to families as customers.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Document Releases

The contract reconsiderations occurred as newly unsealed documents related to Epstein have identified individuals who had business or social relationships with the convicted sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Black's name has appeared in various court filings and financial records released as part of ongoing litigation related to Epstein's activities.

Black has stated he was unaware of Epstein's criminal activities and regrets his association with him.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
