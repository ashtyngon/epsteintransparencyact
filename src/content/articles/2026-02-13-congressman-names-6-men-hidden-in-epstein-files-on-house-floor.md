Rep. Ro Khanna took to the House floor this week to publicly name six wealthy men whose identities had been redacted in the Jeffrey Epstein files, thrusting the California congressman into the national spotlight.

The move — reading names aloud in a protected congressional forum — identified powerful figures who had been shielded from public view. [Our earlier reporting](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-reveals-6-named-in-epstein-files-labels-wexner-co-conspirator) detailed those names and Khanna's direct accusation that billionaire Les Wexner functioned as Epstein's "co-conspirator."

Khanna has spent recent months helping lead the congressional push around the Epstein case, meeting with stakeholders and positioning himself at the center of the transparency fight.

## Political Potency

*The Hill* characterized Khanna's Epstein role as potential "catnip for Democratic voters" — a recognition that the case combines progressive suspicion of billionaire power with mainstream demand for accountability.

The congressman's willingness to name names publicly stands in contrast to colleagues who have remained silent even as [the DOJ faces accusations of covering up file redactions](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) and [courts continue releasing documents](/articles/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents).

His House floor speech created space for other lawmakers to speak more directly about the case. Whether that translates into lasting political capital remains unclear, but Khanna has claimed an issue where voter anger at elite impunity runs deep.

The [Epstein Transparency Act](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) mandates ongoing file releases, ensuring the issue won't fade quickly. As the [FBI reviews records under the new law](/articles/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review), Khanna has positioned himself to continue demanding answers.
