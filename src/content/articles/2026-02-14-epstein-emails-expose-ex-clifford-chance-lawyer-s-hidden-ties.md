A former trainee at **Clifford Chance**, one of the world's largest law firms, was named in newly released Epstein documents after hundreds of emails between her and **Jeffrey Epstein** were disclosed by the Department of Justice, according to Law.com.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The revelation is part of a broader week of fallout from the Epstein files that has produced executive resignations, congressional floor speeches naming redacted individuals and sharp clashes between lawmakers and the DOJ.

## The Clifford Chance Connection

The former trainee, identified only as "V" in legal filings, worked in Clifford Chance's Paris office from 2011 to 2012, according to RollOnFriday.<sup>[16](#ref-16)</sup> The correspondence began in the summer of 2011, when the woman was 21 and Epstein was 58 -- three years after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.<sup>[16](#ref-16)</sup>

The emails included exchanges that were sexual in nature and did not reflect an attorney-client relationship, according to Law.com.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Some emails appeared to have been sent from a work account bearing a Clifford Chance signature block.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Other messages showed her seeking career advice, including guidance on applications to other firms.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

After leaving Clifford Chance in 2012, the woman continued corresponding with Epstein until at least 2019, months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges, according to RollOnFriday.<sup>[16](#ref-16)</sup> Through her attorneys at Boies Schiller Flexner, the woman identified herself as a victim of Epstein and said her name had been inadvertently left unredacted in the DOJ release.<sup>[16](#ref-16)</sup>

A Clifford Chance spokesperson told RollOnFriday the firm had never acted for Epstein and that the correspondence was unrelated to firm business.<sup>[16](#ref-16)</sup>

## Congressional Floor Speeches

**Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.)** and **Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)** have used the Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution to [name individuals](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) whose identities remain redacted in the official release. Massie named six men during one floor speech.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

**Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche** responded by accusing the lawmakers of naming "completely random people," according to The Hill.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The Guardian confirmed that four men named by Khanna had no documented Epstein ties, but other individuals named from the floor have subsequently departed their positions.<sup>[13](#ref-13)</sup>

## Executive Departures

**Kathryn Ruemmler**, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, [resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after emails surfaced in the files, according to Axios.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> **Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem**, CEO and chairman of DP World, [stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after appearing 4,700 times in the documents, according to CBS News.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Wexner and Political Connections

**Leslie Wexner**, the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret and Epstein's only confirmed financial client, gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion to Epstein for $0, according to public records.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup> A [congressman labeled Wexner a "co-conspirator"](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) on the House floor.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Wexner has not been charged with any crime related to Epstein.

[A separate report](/news/2026-02-13-senator-blocked-epstein-files-after-receiving-mysterious-donation) documented that a senator voted against the Epstein Transparency Act after his PAC received a donation from a group whose donors include individuals named in the files.<sup>[10](#ref-10)</sup>

## The Disclosure Gap

Members of Congress have access to unredacted files through their oversight authority. The public does not.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The DOJ was also found to have been [tracking which lawmakers searched the files](/news/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches), raising constitutional concerns.<sup>[14](#ref-14)</sup>

The congressional investigation continues. Multiple figures have been called to testify, including [Lord **Peter Mandelson**](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) and Wexner.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup><sup>[15](#ref-15)</sup> Attorney General **Pam Bondi** has faced bipartisan criticism over the pace and scope of the releases.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>
