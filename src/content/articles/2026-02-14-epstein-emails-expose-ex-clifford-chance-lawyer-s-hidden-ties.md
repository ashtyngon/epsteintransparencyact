Members of Congress have begun reading names into the public record from the House floor -- a constitutional maneuver that bypasses DOJ redactions. In response, **Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche** accused the lawmakers of naming "completely random people," according to The Hill.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> At the same time, executives at Goldman Sachs and DP World have departed following the release of documents containing their names.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup><sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Congressional Floor Speeches

**Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.)** and **Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)** have used the Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution -- which provides immunity for statements made on the House floor -- to name individuals whose identities remain redacted in the official Epstein files release.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> **Massie named six men** during one floor speech.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

**Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche** responded by accusing Khanna and Massie of naming "completely random people" in relation to the DOJ's Epstein investigation, according to The Hill.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## The Goldman Sachs Departure

**Kathryn Ruemmler**, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned after emails surfaced showing what PBS NewsHour described as a relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Previous reporting detailed emails in the files referring to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey."<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Ruemmler's resignation was effective June 30, according to Axios.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## The DP World CEO Departure

**Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem**, CEO and chairman of **DP World**, one of the world's largest port operators, departed after appearing **4,700 times in the Epstein files**, according to CBS News.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The nature of these mentions has not been publicly disclosed. DP World issued a statement citing "strategic realignment."<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> **Rep. Massie** commented on the departure, according to Spectrum News.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## University of Alabama Connection

According to WVTM, **DOJ records indicate Jeffrey Epstein helped arrange a guest speaker at the University of Alabama**.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

[Previous reporting](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) documented how college presidents and professors appeared in the files in connection with Epstein's academic contacts.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> Details about the Alabama speaker arrangement -- including the identity of the speaker and the timing of the event -- have not been disclosed.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## The Clifford Chance Connection

A former trainee at **Clifford Chance**, one of the world's largest law firms, was named in newly released Epstein documents, according to Law.com.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Details about the nature of the contact remain limited.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein's defense team during his 2008 plea deal included Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr, who negotiated an agreement with then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta that resulted in 13 months of county jail with work release.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Wexner and Campaign Contributions

**Leslie Wexner**, the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret and Epstein's only confirmed financial client, gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion at 9 East 71st Street to Epstein for $0, according to public records.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup> [A congressman labeled Wexner a "co-conspirator"](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) on the House floor.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Wexner has not been charged with any crime related to Epstein.

Reporting from WFMJ.com found that **Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner**.<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>

[A separate report](/news/2026-02-13-senator-blocked-epstein-files-after-receiving-mysterious-donation) documented that a senator voted against the Epstein Transparency Act after his PAC received a donation from a group whose donors include individuals named in the files.<sup>[10](#ref-10)</sup>

## Prince Andrew

**Prince Andrew** settled Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit in February 2022 for a reported 12 million pounds without admitting wrongdoing.<sup>[11](#ref-11)</sup> The Guardian reported that **former Prime Minister Gordon Brown** has reviewed portions of the Epstein files, and calls for a police investigation have increased.<sup>[11](#ref-11)</sup>

Previous reporting on this site documented how [Andrew's BBC interview claims have been contradicted by newly released emails](/news/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface).<sup>[12](#ref-12)</sup>

## The DOJ Response

Deputy Attorney General Blanche's decision to publicly criticize Congressional transparency advocates was notable, as DOJ officials rarely call out members of Congress by name.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The characterization of the named individuals as "completely random people" has been disputed. The Guardian confirmed that four men named by Khanna had no documented Epstein ties, but other individuals named from the floor have subsequently departed their positions.<sup>[13](#ref-13)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup><sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## The Disclosure Gap

Members of Congress have access to unredacted files through their oversight authority. The public does not.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act was designed to mandate broad disclosure. In practice, members of Congress have been reading names from the House floor that remain redacted in the official DOJ releases, while the DOJ has criticized those disclosures.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## This Week's Developments

This week's developments include:

- A Goldman Sachs general counsel departed after emails surfaced in the files<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>
- A DP World CEO departed after 4,700 file mentions<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>
- A former Clifford Chance trainee was named in newly released documents<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
- University officials were named in connection with Epstein's academic contacts<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>
- Ohio politicians face questions about Wexner campaign contributions<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>
- Prince Andrew faces increased pressure to cooperate with authorities<sup>[11](#ref-11)</sup>
- The Deputy AG criticized congressmen who named individuals from the files<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Outstanding Questions

Victims have called for full disclosure of the files. Transparency advocates have argued that redactions fuel speculation about those with incidental connections to Epstein. The DOJ has maintained that privacy concerns and ongoing investigations justify the redactions.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Earlier this week, documents indicated the DOJ had been [tracking which lawmakers searched the Epstein files](/news/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches), according to The Hill.<sup>[14](#ref-14)</sup>

## What Comes Next

The congressional investigation continues. Multiple figures have been called to testify, including Lord Mandelson and Les Wexner.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup><sup>[15](#ref-15)</sup> The House Judiciary Committee has questioned Attorney General Bondi over the pace and scope of releases.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act mandated a methodical review and release of documents. The process has instead involved congressional floor speeches disclosing redacted names, DOJ criticism of those disclosures, and a series of executive departures.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>
