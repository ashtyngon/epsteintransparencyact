Dan Ariely, a Duke University professor known for his research on irrational behavior and ethics, exchanged messages with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that extended beyond research collaboration, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The correspondence between the two men spanned multiple years and included discussions that were not strictly academic in nature.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Ariely sought out Epstein for his research work, according to The New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Post-Conviction Contact

Ariely's communication with Epstein occurred after the financier's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor, a plea deal that allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges at the time.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The newly disclosed emails suggest Ariely maintained contact with Epstein despite the conviction and its public disclosure.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Ariely built his career at Duke studying dishonesty, behavioral economics, and ethical decision-making. He is the author of several books on the subject, including works examining why people lie and cheat. The revelation that a scholar of dishonesty corresponded extensively with a convicted sex offender has drawn scrutiny from the university community and the public.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Duke University Response

Duke University has not yet announced any formal review of Ariely's position or his relationship with Epstein. Ariely remains a faculty member at the university's Fuqua School of Business.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The disclosure adds Duke to a growing list of academic institutions facing questions about faculty ties to Epstein. Columbia University has already removed officials connected to Epstein, and Harvard placed Larry Summers on leave pending an investigation into his Epstein correspondence.
