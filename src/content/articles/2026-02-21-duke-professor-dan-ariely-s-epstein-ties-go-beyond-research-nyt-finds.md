A behavioral scientist who built his career studying dishonesty corresponded with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for years, newly disclosed emails show, while a prominent Olympic organizer's meetings with Epstein have raised concerns about the 2028 Los Angeles Games.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

**Dan Ariely**, a Duke University professor known for his research on irrational behavior and ethics, exchanged messages with Epstein that extended beyond research collaboration, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The correspondence between the two men spanned multiple years and included discussions that were not strictly academic in nature.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Ariely sought out Epstein for his research work, according to The New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The professor's communication with the financier occurred after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, a plea deal that allowed him to avoid federal charges at the time.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Olympic Planning Faces Scrutiny

**Casey Wasserman**, chairman of LA28, the organizing committee for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, met with Epstein multiple times, according to newly released documents.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The disclosure of these meetings has contributed to what The New York Times described as planning thrown "into disarray" for the upcoming Games.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Wasserman's ties to Epstein emerged in the latest batch of documents released under legal proceedings.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The meetings occurred during the period when Wasserman was building his sports and entertainment empire, though the documents do not specify the exact dates or nature of their discussions.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The Olympic committee is simultaneously facing concerns over key infrastructure projects needed for the 2028 Games, according to The New York Times.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The combination of the Epstein revelations and construction anxieties has created what the newspaper characterized as "a cloud of concerns" over the event.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Florida University Search Committee Member Named

A member of the University of Florida's presidential search committee had stronger connections to Epstein than previously known, according to documents in the latest file release.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The Independent Florida Alligator reported that the new materials show expanded ties between the unnamed search committee member and the deceased financier.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The documents did not identify which specific member of the search committee had the Epstein connections or detail the nature of those relationships.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The University of Florida has been conducting a search for its next president, with the committee tasked with identifying and vetting candidates for the position.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## School Photography Company Mentioned

Lifetouch, a national school photography company, appeared in the Epstein files, prompting responses from local school districts, according to the Longview News-Journal.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> The Texas newspaper reported that school districts in its coverage area addressed questions about the company's presence in the documents.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

The nature of Lifetouch's connection to Epstein as detailed in the files was not specified in the News-Journal's report.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> Lifetouch operates as a major provider of school portrait photography services across the United States, contracting with thousands of school districts nationwide.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

## UK-US Enforcement Contrast

British authorities arrested Prince Andrew on Thursday morning at the Sandringham royal estate on allegations he shared confidential material with Epstein, while US officials have pursued few prosecutions of Epstein's alleged co-conspirators, The Guardian reported.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

**Pam Bondi**, the US Attorney General, declined to answer questions about how many of Epstein's co-conspirators the Justice Department had indicted when asked at a press conference one week before Andrew's arrest.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Bondi also refused to say whether she would provide state attorneys general with access to evidence for building additional cases.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The Guardian described the arrest as "a seismic shock for the monarchy" and noted that "in Britain, the establishment has been shaken to the core by the files."<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> By contrast, the newspaper reported that in the United States, "'the Epstein class' has faced little legal or political reckoning."<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Early Warning Signs Documented

The newly released files show an accuser provided authorities with an extensive account of abuse in 2011, raising questions about why action was not taken, The Guardian reported in a separate article.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The documents provide additional insight into what authorities knew about allegations against Epstein in the years between his 2008 plea deal and his federal arrest in 2019.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

An accuser first reported Epstein to authorities in 1996, according to The Guardian.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The Department of Justice's release of millions of Epstein files has renewed attention on law enforcement's failure to stop him despite multiple reports over the years.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

The 2008 plea agreement allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida, avoiding federal prosecution.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> He served 13 months in a county jail with work-release privileges before his July 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 in what officials ruled a suicide.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>
