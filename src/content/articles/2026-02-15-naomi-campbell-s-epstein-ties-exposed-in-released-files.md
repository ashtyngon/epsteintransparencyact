**Naomi Campbell** told reporters in 2020 that **Jeffrey Epstein** was merely "an acquaintance" she had met through the fashion industry. Documents released by the Department of Justice tell a more detailed story: Campbell's name appears nearly 300 times across the newly unsealed files, making her one of the most frequently mentioned female celebrities in the 3.5-million-page release.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The DOJ records include email exchanges, calendar entries and travel coordination spanning years of contact between the British supermodel and the convicted sex offender. The entries range from brief scheduling notes to detailed arrangements for meetings and flights.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Flights, Dinners and Island Visits

Email chains obtained by the New York Times show Campbell coordinating travel through Epstein's assistant, with messages discussing pickup times, locations and social invitations to dinners at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> In a 2015 email to Epstein's assistant, Campbell wrote that she wanted to see Epstein and discussed her upcoming travel plans.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

In January 2016, Campbell requested use of Epstein's private jet to travel to Miami. Epstein declined.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Handwritten notes from FBI interviews conducted in 2019 list Campbell among individuals who visited Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other interview transcripts include accounts from witnesses who said they saw her at his Manhattan residence.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Epstein was also invited to events on Campbell's behalf. One email references an invitation to a celebration of Campbell's 25-year career with the fashion house Dolce & Gabbana in Paris.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Contact Continued After 2008 Conviction

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor in Florida and served 18 months in a county jail under a widely criticized plea agreement. Email timestamps show correspondence between Campbell and Epstein continued after his conviction and release, extending through at least 2016.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## **Ghislaine Maxwell** Connection

Separately, released files show Maxwell -- Epstein's longtime associate who is [currently fighting the release of additional documents](/news/2026-02-21-ghislaine-maxwell-fights-release-of-90-000-epstein-files/) -- offered Campbell "two playmates" in one communication, raising additional questions about the nature of Campbell's involvement with Epstein's inner circle.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Epstein Used Campbell's Name to Recruit Victims

FBI interview transcripts reveal that Epstein invoked his association with Campbell when recruiting young women, dangling the promise of modeling careers to lure them. One unnamed victim, who said she met Epstein when she was 15, told investigators that Epstein promised to get her jobs at Victoria's Secret and told her he knew Campbell personally.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Campbell has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with that recruitment, and no evidence in the files suggests she was aware of those conversations.

## Campbell's Attorney Responds

Campbell's lawyer, **Martin Singer**, said in a February 2026 statement that his client knew nothing about Epstein's criminal conduct before his 2019 arrest. Singer added that had Campbell ever encountered a young woman she believed was being victimized, she would have taken immediate action.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

**Virginia Giuffre**, who alleged Epstein trafficked her to powerful men, did not name Campbell in her accusations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Broader Context

The DOJ release is part of the largest disclosure of Epstein-related records to date. Multiple executives and officials have [left their positions](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-files-topple-european-elites-while-u-s-officials-keep-power/) after being named in the files, and [business leaders across industries face mounting professional fallout](/news/2026-02-18-business-leaders-face-fallout-after-epstein-files-exposure/).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Legal analysts have cautioned that a name appearing in the DOJ files does not constitute evidence of criminal behavior. The Justice Department itself has warned that some material in the cache could be unverified or inaccurate.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Campbell has not publicly addressed the newly released documents.
