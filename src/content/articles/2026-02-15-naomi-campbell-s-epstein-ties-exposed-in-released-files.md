Naomi Campbell told media in 2020 that Jeffrey Epstein was "an acquaintance" she met "more than 15 years ago" through the fashion industry. Emails released by the Department of Justice show years of correspondence between the supermodel and the convicted sex offender that included coordinating flights, meetings, and social events.

The emails document interactions extending beyond casual acquaintance, according to The New York Times. Epstein arranged flights for Campbell on his private aircraft. Messages reference meetings at his properties in New York and the Virgin Islands.

## Travel and Social Coordination

One email chain coordinates Campbell's travel schedule with Epstein's assistant, discussing pickup times and locations. Other messages contain social invitations and responses about dinners at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse.

The emails show Epstein introducing Campbell to potential donors for her charity work in Africa. Campbell founded Fashion for Relief, a charitable organization, in 2005.

## Contact After Conviction

The correspondence spans from 2002 to 2010, with multiple exchanges per year after 2005, according to timestamps on the emails.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida and served 18 months. The emails show continued correspondence between Epstein and Campbell after his conviction and release.

## No Allegations Against Campbell

The emails contain no allegations of illegal activity by Campbell. They document the scope and duration of contact between the two.

Campbell told media in 2020 that she was "not aware of his illegal activity." Her representatives issued a statement following Virginia Giuffre's allegations that Epstein had trafficked her to powerful men. Campbell was not accused of wrongdoing in those allegations.

Campbell's representatives did not respond to requests for comment from The New York Times about the newly released emails. Her attorney declined to provide a statement.

## Broader Fallout

The DOJ release includes millions of pages of documents from Epstein's files. Multiple executives and officials have [resigned from positions](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-files-topple-european-elites-while-u-s-officials-keep-power) after their names appeared in the files.

Campbell continues to work in the fashion industry and maintains her charitable foundation. She has not addressed the newly released emails publicly.
