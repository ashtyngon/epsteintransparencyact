**Don Huffines**, a Republican candidate for Texas comptroller who describes himself as a "MAGA Trump Republican," owns **Jeffrey Epstein's former Zorro Ranch** in New Mexico, according to property records. The revelation comes as Rep. **Thomas Massie** continues pressing the Department of Justice over what he characterizes as incomplete disclosure of Epstein-related documents, despite a federal law mandating their release.

Huffines acquired the **10,000-acre property** in Stanley, New Mexico, where Epstein allegedly abused underage girls, according to The Independent. The ranch served as one of Epstein's primary residences before his 2019 death in federal custody. Texas GOP officials [expressed alarm over the purchase](/news/2026-02-15-texas-gop-alarmed-over-comptroller-candidate-s-epstein-ranch-purchase) earlier this month.

The property purchase has created complications for Huffines's campaign in a race where Republican primary voters have shown intense interest in Epstein-related issues. Huffines has not publicly addressed when he purchased the property or his intentions for the site.

## Massie: Key Documents Still Missing

Massie told The American Conservative that the DOJ continues withholding Epstein documents despite the Epstein Transparency Act, which [became federal law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) and required comprehensive disclosure. The Kentucky Republican has emerged as one of the most vocal congressional critics of the DOJ's handling of the files.

"They're still not releasing everything," Massie said, according to the outlet. His comments follow multiple confrontations with Attorney General **Pam Bondi** over the scope of document releases.

Massie [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) on Feb. 14 as pressure mounted over his demands for fuller disclosure. He ripped the Trump DOJ on Feb. 15 over continued redactions and lost confidence in AG Bondi after what he described as her avoidance of eye contact with Epstein survivors during congressional testimony.

The congressman's criticism centers on discrepancies between Bondi's public statements and the actual content of releases. Bondi claimed the DOJ released "all" Epstein files and defended the releases as complete, but lawmakers including Rep. **Nancy Mace** accused the DOJ of hiding names.

## Volume Comparison to Other Leaks

The Sunday Guardian compared the Epstein files to previous major document releases, finding the Epstein materials "massive in volume but still smaller than the Pandora, Panama, & Paradise Papers." The Pandora Papers comprised 11.9 million documents, the Panama Papers 11.5 million, and the Paradise Papers 13.4 million, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

The comparison provides context for the DOJ's explanation that files remain heavily redacted to protect ongoing investigations. However, one expert warned that raw file releases could compromise prosecutions.

Bondi released a list of 300 names on Feb. 15, but Congress accused her of "mudding" the list by including dead celebrities. Rep. **Ro Khanna** and other lawmakers argued the inclusion of deceased individuals who could not face consequences diluted the impact of releasing names of living associates.

## Political Fallout Continues

The files have triggered global resignations and new investigations across multiple countries. European elites have toppled while U.S. officials largely retain positions, creating questions about differential accountability.

Commerce Secretary **Howard Lutnick**'s Epstein contacts have become a GOP liability, with GOP senators viewing the associations as a political problem. Rep. **Marjorie Taylor Greene** blasted Trump's handling of the files as a "political miscalculation," a rare public criticism of the former president from the Georgia Republican.

President Trump separately called for ending the Epstein investigation, drawing criticism from transparency advocates. The position contrasts with his earlier campaign promises for full disclosure.

International responses have accelerated. France set up a special team to review files for French nationals. UK police launched a national task force for trafficking allegations, with Britain's top prosecutor stating "nobody above law" as police probe **Prince Andrew**. French prosecutors opened an investigation into a diplomat.

## New Tools for Public Access

A platform called **JeffTube** launched to make DOJ Epstein files easier to browse, according to reports. The tool responds to public demand for searchable access to the materials. Epstein emails spread across social media in viral leaks before and after official releases.

The New York Times launched a major investigation into millions of Epstein files. The Times previously published an investigation revealing how elite immunity protected Epstein.

## Congressional Actions

Congress has issued multiple subpoenas as part of its oversight. Lawmakers subpoenaed Peter Mandelson and billionaire Les Wexner to testify. Khanna demanded names after a major associate stepped down.

One lawmaker named six men hidden in Epstein files despite the transparency law. A senator blocked Epstein files after receiving a mysterious donation, according to earlier reporting.

Bondi appeared before multiple congressional committees defending DOJ actions. She was grilled on why she resists full document release. She was also caught spying on Democrats' Epstein files searches, creating additional controversy.

## Scope of Released Materials

The files have named individuals across sectors. College presidents and professors appeared in releases. Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned after being named. Dubai's ports chief resigned after hundreds of secret emails were exposed.

Notable business figures appeared throughout documents. Casey Wasserman sold his agency after files exposed ties, and separately exited as Olympic chief after Maxwell email revelations. Orioles owner David Rubenstein was named. Trump insider Tom Barrack appeared.

Media and entertainment figures faced scrutiny. Piers Morgan appeared 29 times in files. Media mogul Michael Ferro canceled a last-minute Epstein meeting, according to emails. Naomi Campbell's ties were exposed. Podcaster **Joe Rogan** said the files "scare the hell out of me" during his show.

International figures appeared throughout releases. Indian businessman, minister, and guru were named. Nobel chief Thorbjørn Jagland got gifts from Epstein, according to emails. Files showed Epstein used Nobel Prize access to lure his elite network.

## New Evidence on Institutional Connections

Documents revealed institutional penetration beyond individual contacts. DOJ files showed Epstein pulled strings at the University of Alabama. NYC schools chief Joel Klein met with Epstein in 2013. Craven County Schools responded after student records appeared in files.

Financial institutions faced legal consequences. A court allowed a Bank of America Epstein trafficking lawsuit to proceed. Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner, Epstein's longtime associate and former business partner.

Political fundraising connections emerged. Consultants pitched Epstein access to New York Democrats for donations, according to documents. Files showed Epstein sympathized with Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation.

## Prince Andrew Evidence Mounts

Prince Andrew's BBC claims unraveled as new Epstein emails surfaced. The Duke of York told the BBC in 2019 he had limited contact with Epstein after 2006. Emails contradict that timeline.

Prince Andrew's aide advised Epstein to hide his conviction on visa forms, according to documents released Feb. 14. The advice concerned Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida.

## Legal Professional Connections

An ex-Clifford Chance lawyer's hidden ties were exposed in emails. The materials add to evidence of Epstein's connections to elite law firms.

## Unusual Allegations Surface

Steve Bannon discussed "taking down" Pope Francis with Epstein, according to DOJ files. The conversation occurred before Bannon joined the Trump campaign as chief executive in August 2016.

## Survivor Testimony

**Juliette Bryant**, an Epstein survivor, said "thought I was going to die" in testimony describing her abuse. Bryant's account adds to documented testimony from multiple survivors about conditions they experienced.

## Maxwell Clemency Offer

**Ghislaine Maxwell** offered to reveal "truth" in exchange for clemency from her Florida federal prison cell. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The Justice Department has not responded to her proposal.

## Video Evidence Released

Newly released video from Epstein's office appeared in the latest files dump, according to reports. The DOJ has not specified the content or date of the footage.

## Systemic Questions

Analysis pieces have examined broader implications. One article argued the Epstein case exposes cracks in America's rule of law system. Rep. Khanna said Epstein's network "knew enough to know better" about his criminal behavior.
