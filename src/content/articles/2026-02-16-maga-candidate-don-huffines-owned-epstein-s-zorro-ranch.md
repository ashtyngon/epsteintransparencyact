**Don Huffines**, a Republican candidate for Texas comptroller who describes himself as a "MAGA Trump Republican," owns **Jeffrey Epstein's former Zorro Ranch** in New Mexico, according to property records. The revelation comes as Rep. **Thomas Massie** continues pressing the Department of Justice over what he characterizes as incomplete disclosure of Epstein-related documents, despite a federal law mandating their release.

Huffines acquired the **10,000-acre property** in Stanley, New Mexico, where Epstein allegedly abused underage girls, according to The Independent. The ranch served as one of Epstein's primary residences before his 2019 death in federal custody. Texas GOP officials [expressed alarm over the purchase](/news/2026-02-15-texas-gop-alarmed-over-comptroller-candidate-s-epstein-ranch-purchase) earlier this month.

The property purchase has created complications for Huffines's campaign in a race where Republican primary voters have shown intense interest in Epstein-related issues. Huffines has not publicly addressed when he purchased the property or his intentions for the site.

## Massie: Key Documents Still Missing

Massie told The American Conservative that the DOJ continues withholding Epstein documents despite the Epstein Transparency Act, which [became federal law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) and required comprehensive disclosure. The Kentucky Republican has emerged as one of the most vocal congressional critics of the DOJ's handling of the files.

"They're still not releasing everything," Massie said, according to the outlet. His comments follow multiple confrontations with Attorney General **Pam Bondi** over the scope of document releases.

Massie [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) on Feb. 14 as pressure mounted over his demands for fuller disclosure. He [ripped the Trump DOJ](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) on Feb. 15 over continued redactions and [lost confidence in AG Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) after what he described as her [avoidance of eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) during congressional testimony.

The congressman's criticism centers on discrepancies between Bondi's public statements and the actual content of releases. Bondi [claimed the DOJ released "all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed) and [defended the releases as complete](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more), but lawmakers including Rep. **Nancy Mace** [accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release).

## Volume Comparison to Other Leaks

The Sunday Guardian compared the Epstein files to previous major document releases, finding the Epstein materials "massive in volume but still smaller than the Pandora, Panama, & Paradise Papers." The Pandora Papers comprised 11.9 million documents, the Panama Papers 11.5 million, and the Paradise Papers 13.4 million, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

The comparison provides context for the DOJ's [explanation that files remain heavily redacted](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) to protect ongoing investigations. However, [one expert warned](/news/2026-02-14-expert-warns-raw-epstein-file-release-could-harm-ongoing-investigations) that raw file releases could compromise prosecutions.

Bondi [released a list of 300 names](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release) on Feb. 15, but Congress [accused her of "mudding" the list](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) by including [dead celebrities](/news/2026-02-15-bondi-named-dead-celebrities-in-epstein-email-list). Rep. **Ro Khanna** and other lawmakers argued the inclusion of deceased individuals who could not face consequences diluted the impact of releasing names of living associates.

## Political Fallout Continues

The files have triggered [global resignations and new investigations](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-files-trigger-global-resignations-new-investigations) across multiple countries. [European elites have toppled](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-files-topple-european-elites-while-u-s-officials-keep-power) while U.S. officials largely retain positions, creating questions about differential accountability.

Commerce Secretary **Howard Lutnick**'s Epstein contacts have become [a GOP liability](/news/2026-02-15-commerce-secretary-lutnick-s-epstein-ties-become-gop-liability), with [GOP senators viewing the associations as a political problem](/news/2026-02-15-gop-senators-view-lutnick-s-epstein-contacts-as-political-liability). Rep. **Marjorie Taylor Greene** [blasted Trump's handling](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) of the files as a "political miscalculation," a rare public criticism of the former president from the Georgia Republican.

President Trump separately [called for ending the Epstein investigation](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation), drawing criticism from transparency advocates. The position contrasts with his earlier campaign promises for full disclosure.

International responses have accelerated. [France set up a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review files for French nationals.

[French prosecutors opened an investigation](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) into a diplomat.

## New Tools for Public Access

[Epstein emails spread across social media in viral leaks](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-emails-spread-across-social-media-in-viral-leak) before and after official releases.

The [New York Times launched a major investigation](/news/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into millions of Epstein files. The Times previously [published an investigation revealing how elite immunity protected Epstein](/news/2026-02-13-how-elite-immunity-protected-epstein-nyt-investigation-reveals).

## Congressional Actions

Congress has issued multiple subpoenas as part of its oversight. Lawmakers [subpoenaed Peter Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) and [billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify.

A [senator blocked Epstein files after receiving a mysterious donation](/news/2026-02-13-senator-blocked-epstein-files-after-receiving-mysterious-donation), according to earlier reporting.

Bondi appeared before multiple congressional committees defending DOJ actions. She [was grilled on why she resists full document release](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release).
