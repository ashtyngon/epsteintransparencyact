An Emirati billionaire has resigned as CEO of a major logistics company following revelations about his connections to Jeffrey Epstein, marking another corporate casualty in the widening fallout from newly released government files.

The executive's departure comes days after [DP World CEO Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem was forced out](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails) when emails surfaced linking him to Epstein's network. That resignation sent shockwaves through global shipping, as DP World operates critical port infrastructure across six continents.

## Second Major Exit This Week

The logistics executive joins [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, who stepped down](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-epstein-links) after documents revealed he had called Epstein an "older brother" figure. Both departures happened within days of their names appearing in document releases mandated by the new transparency law.

Corporate boards are scrambling to assess their executives' connections to Epstein's network. What began as a trickle of names has become a flood, exposing relationships that remained hidden for years behind sealed court records and federal secrecy.

## Pattern of Protection Unravels

These resignations expose a troubling reality: executives with direct ties to a convicted sex offender held positions of power at firms handling billions in global commerce. Whether their companies knew about these relationships—and when—remains an open question.

[Bank of America is already defending itself in court](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed) over allegations it facilitated Epstein's operation through financial services. The lawsuits and resignations suggest Epstein's corporate network extended far deeper than previously acknowledged.

Representative Ro Khanna [demanded full public disclosure](/articles/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down) of everyone connected to Epstein's operation after the first executive resigned. His call grows more urgent with each new departure.

## More Names Coming

With millions of pages still under federal review, the executive exits are likely just beginning. The documents are pulling back the curtain on a network that spanned Wall Street, international shipping, academia, and government—all of it protected until now by classification and sealed court files.

Companies face a choice: get ahead of the releases by conducting internal reviews, or wait for the next document dump to reveal which of their executives appears in Epstein's files. So far, most have chosen to wait. That strategy is starting to look reckless.
