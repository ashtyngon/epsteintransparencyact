**Donald Huffines**, a Texas businessman and former Republican state senator now running for Texas comptroller, confirmed through a spokesperson that his family purchased Jeffrey Epstein's notorious **Zorro Ranch** in New Mexico for **$13.4 million** in 2023. The 7,500-acre property served as a location where Epstein abused teenage girls and young women, according to court documents and survivor testimony.

The confirmation came after documents surfaced linking the Huffines family to the property purchase. Huffines identifies as a "Trump Republican" and is currently seeking the Texas comptroller position in the state's GOP primary.

The ranch acquisition adds to mounting questions about how Epstein's physical assets have been distributed in the years following his August 2019 death in federal custody. The property had been part of Epstein's estate, which has faced numerous civil claims from survivors.

## Bannon's Continued Contact With Epstein

Text messages released by the Department of Justice show **Steve Bannon** maintained what the New York Times described as a "seemingly chummy relationship" with Epstein despite the financier's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The messages indicate Bannon stood by Epstein even as the sex trafficker faced mounting public scrutiny.

Bannon told the Times he maintained contact with Epstein "in the name of getting Mr. Epstein to open up." The newly released texts show communications between the two men that go beyond what Bannon has previously acknowledged about their relationship.

The DOJ document release included correspondence showing Bannon and Epstein [discussed "taking down" Pope Francis](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files), according to previously reported files. The new texts add detail to the timeline and nature of their interactions.

## Federal Transparency Law vs. DOJ Release

**Rep. Thomas Massie** stated in a new interview with The American Conservative that the Department of Justice continues to withhold Epstein documents despite the federal disclosure law requiring their release. Massie's comments came days after he [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files.

The Kentucky congressman [lost confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) after what he described as her failure to adequately address his concerns about redactions and withheld documents. Massie previously accused Bondi of [avoiding eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) during a congressional hearing.

An independent analysis found that [the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows), despite Bondi's claim that the department released ["all" files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed). The study compared the volume of released documents to known holdings in FBI and DOJ custody.

## British Royal Connections Under New Scrutiny

**Sarah Ferguson**, the Duchess of York, moved to wind down six of her companies following what the BBC described as "further revelations over her friendship" with Epstein. The filings came as British authorities continue reviewing Epstein connections among UK figures.

The UK established a [national police task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations connected to Epstein's British contacts. Britain's top prosecutor stated ["nobody above law"](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) as police continue their probe of Prince Andrew.

New documents contradicted [Prince Andrew's BBC claims](/news/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface) about the extent of his contact with Epstein. Separate emails showed [an aide to Prince Andrew advised Epstein](/news/2026-02-14-prince-andrew-s-aide-advised-epstein-to-hide-conviction-on-visa-form) to hide his conviction on a visa form, according to DOJ files.

## International Investigations Expand

**France** established a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals, according to The Independent's report on countries launching investigations. French prosecutors separately [opened an investigation into a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) connected to Epstein, according to previous reporting.

Transparency International UK released an analysis examining what emails between **Peter Mandelson** and Epstein reveal about Britain's lobbying system. The organization's report came after [Congress subpoenaed Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) over his Epstein ties in what lawmakers described as a major probe.

The Independent documented that multiple European countries have launched formal investigations or reviews of their citizens' connections to Epstein. The report identified specific probes in the UK, France, and other nations examining whether crimes occurred within their jurisdictions.

## Volume vs. Impact of File Release

The Sunday Guardian published an analysis comparing the Epstein files to major document leaks including the Pandora Papers, Panama Papers, and Paradise Papers. The comparison showed the Epstein release contains fewer total pages than those massive financial disclosure leaks, despite the significant public attention.

The Guardian analysis noted that while the Epstein files are "massive in volume," they remain smaller than the multi-million document dumps that exposed offshore financial networks. The comparison provides context for understanding the scale of the DOJ release relative to other major document disclosures.

The comparison also highlighted differences in how the documents were released. The Panama Papers and related leaks came from whistleblowers and investigative journalism collaborations, while the Epstein files emerged through a federal transparency law and court orders.

## Ongoing Congressional Action

[Rep. Ro Khanna stated](/news/2026-02-16-rep-khanna-epstein-s-network-knew-enough-to-know-better) that Epstein's network "knew enough to know better" in comments about the figures documented in the files. [Rep. Nancy Mace demanded](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files) unredacted co-conspirator files from the DOJ.

Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the scope of DOJ's release. [Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene](/news/2026-02-16-mtg-criticizes-trump-s-epstein-files-handling-as-political-miscalculation) described Trump's handling of the Epstein files as a "political miscalculation."

[Congress previously subpoenaed billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify on his Epstein ties. That subpoena remains active as part of the ongoing congressional investigation into Epstein's network of contacts.
