**Donald Huffines**, a Texas businessman and former Republican state senator running for Texas comptroller, confirmed through a spokesperson that his family purchased Jeffrey Epstein's **Zorro Ranch** in New Mexico for **$13.4 million** in 2023, according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The 7,500-acre property was identified in court documents as a location where Epstein allegedly abused underage girls and young women, according to survivor testimony and court filings.

The confirmation came after documents surfaced connecting the Huffines family to the property purchase. Huffines is currently seeking the Texas comptroller position in the state's GOP primary.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Property History and Abuse Allegations

The Zorro Ranch, located approximately 30 miles south of Santa Fe, was one of several properties Epstein owned across the United States and the Caribbean. Court filings from survivors described the ranch as a location where Epstein brought underage girls, sometimes under the guise of employment or educational opportunities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein purchased the ranch in 1993. The property includes a main residence, guest houses, and an airstrip. New Mexico authorities had previously examined allegations of abuse at the property but did not bring criminal charges during Epstein's lifetime.

The ranch had been part of Epstein's estate following his August 2019 death in federal custody while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The estate has faced numerous civil claims from survivors, and the $13.4 million sale to the Huffines family was part of the estate's liquidation of Epstein's property holdings.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Political Fallout for Huffines

Huffines, who served in the Texas state senate from 2015 to 2019, faced questions from state Republican officials about his family's acquisition of the property where abuse allegedly occurred. His campaign for Texas comptroller has drawn scrutiny since the purchase became public through property records.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Huffines family's spokesperson told The Guardian the purchase was a real estate investment and that the family had no connection to Epstein or knowledge of criminal activity at the property. The spokesperson did not address whether the family was aware of the property's history at the time of purchase.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

New Mexico lawmakers subsequently [voted unanimously to create a "Truth Commission"](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) to investigate what happened at the ranch, marking the first full state-level investigation of the property.
