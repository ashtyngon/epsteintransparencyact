Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who authored the Epstein Transparency Act, stated last week that members of his own party will face political consequences as more files from the case become public, according to MassLive.com.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"I think there are going to be some Republicans who are uncomfortable," Massie told reporters. "There are going to be some Democrats who are uncomfortable. That's just the nature of what we're dealing with here."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Massie made the statement after a House Judiciary Committee hearing where Attorney General Pam Bondi testified about the Department of Justice's release of Epstein-related documents. The hearing centered on [whether the DOJ had complied with the transparency law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) Massie championed.

## Massie's Conflict With Trump Administration

The congressman's statement comes as he has publicly disagreed with the Trump administration over the file release. Massie [criticized what he called excessive redactions](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) in documents released by the DOJ, saying thousands of names remain redacted despite the transparency law's mandate.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

He attended the February 13 hearing with survivors of Epstein's abuse. Massie later said Bondi ["avoided eye contact" with the survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) during her testimony. He subsequently said he had lost confidence in the attorney general over the file release handling.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

An independent analysis found the DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files in its possession. Massie declared "I am not suicidal" in a public statement as pressure mounted around the file release.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, also called the administration's handling of the files a "political miscalculation."

## Bipartisan Consequences

Massie's statement acknowledges that Epstein's documented contacts crossed party lines. Court documents and emails released by the DOJ show the financier maintained contacts with prominent figures in both major political parties.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Multiple executives and officials have left their positions after their names appeared in released files. Casey Wasserman, chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, stepped down after Maxwell email disclosures. Tom Pritzker, heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, resigned from his position as executive chairman after documents showed contact with Epstein's network.

Les Wexner, the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret parent company, faces scrutiny after his name appeared unredacted in files. Congress issued a subpoena for Wexner to testify about his contacts with Epstein. Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances for years, according to previously reported records.

Bondi released a letter listing approximately 300 names from Epstein-related documents, but lawmakers from both parties have called for fuller disclosure. Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, called for unredacted co-conspirator files. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, issued similar calls for complete document releases.
