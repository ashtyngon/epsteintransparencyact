## U.K. Government Weighs Removal of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from Royal Succession Line

The British government is considering removing **Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor** from the line of royal succession following his arrest on charges related to his friendship with convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to CBS News<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The former prince was arrested after allegations about his misconduct in public office emerged in recently released Epstein files<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

Police searched Mountbatten-Windsor's former home on Friday, one day after his arrest, PBS NewsHour reported<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>. The search represents a significant escalation in the British investigation into the former royal's connections to Epstein's criminal network.

British authorities are examining Epstein's use of U.K. airports and pursuing other lines of inquiry related to the case, Time Magazine reported<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>. The investigation follows the former prince's arrest on Thursday morning<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>.

## Pressure Mounts for U.S. Prosecutions

**Annie Farmer**, a survivor of Epstein's abuse, called for American authorities to pursue billionaires connected to Epstein's crimes following Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest. "In this country, it feels like our system prioritizes profit over all else, and so our version of royalty is really" the billionaire class, Farmer told The Hill<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>.

Farmer, who voted for President Trump in the last election, will attend his State of the Union address on Tuesday, The Independent reported<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>. Her presence at the speech comes as scrutiny intensifies on wealthy Americans who maintained ties to Epstein.

The contrast between British law enforcement action and American inaction has become a focal point for survivors seeking accountability. Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest marks the first prosecution of a high-profile figure named in the recently released Epstein files.

## Wexner Deposition Reveals FBI Gap

**Les Wexner**, the billionaire retail mogul and former close associate of Epstein, told Congress he was never contacted by the FBI about his ties to the convicted sex offender, Scripps News reported<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>. The revelation came during a congressional deposition this week examining Wexner's decades-long financial and personal relationship with Epstein.

During the Wednesday deposition, Wexner's attorney was caught on microphone making a profane threat to his client. "I will f‑‑‑ing kill you if you answer another question with more than five words, OK," the lawyer said more than four hours into the proceeding, according to The Hill<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>. The exchange occurred as Wexner provided lengthy responses to questions about his involvement with Epstein.

Wexner founded and led **L Brands**, the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Epstein managed Wexner's personal finances for years and held power of attorney over his affairs. The billionaire has previously stated he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after learning of his crimes.

The FBI's failure to contact Wexner during any investigation of Epstein raises questions about the scope and thoroughness of federal inquiries into the sex trafficking network. Wexner's name appears throughout newly released documents detailing Epstein's financial dealings and social connections.

## Epstein's Pre-Arrest Luxury Purchase Attempt

Days before his July 2019 arrest, Epstein attempted to purchase **Bin Ennakhil**, a luxury palace in Marrakesh, Morocco, The Independent reported<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>. The property features gold-draped walls, a hammam steam spa, 60 marble fountains, and an outdoor pool and jacuzzi, spreading across a total plot of 4.6 hectares<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>.

The attempted purchase involved wire payments and transfers in the days immediately preceding Epstein's arrest on federal sex trafficking charges<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>. The transaction details emerged in recently disclosed financial records related to Epstein's estate and business operations.

The timing of the luxury real estate transaction coincided with Epstein's return to the United States from overseas travel. Federal agents arrested him at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on July 6, 2019.

## New Names Surface in Released Files

A new list of people named in the Epstein files has emerged, the Boston University News Service reported<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>. The latest batch of documents continues to expand the public record of individuals who had contact with Epstein or appear in materials related to his criminal activities and civil litigation.

The ongoing release of court documents stems from civil litigation related to Epstein's crimes. Courts have unsealed thousands of pages of depositions, flight logs, and other materials that detail the scope of Epstein's social and business networks.

The documents include testimony from victims, correspondence between Epstein and associates, and records of financial transactions. Multiple law enforcement agencies have access to the materials as part of ongoing investigations into potential criminal conduct by Epstein's associates.

Federal prosecutors have stated that no new U.S. charges have been filed following recent document releases. The Department of Justice has not announced any active investigations into individuals named in the files, despite calls from survivors and members of Congress for expanded prosecutions.
