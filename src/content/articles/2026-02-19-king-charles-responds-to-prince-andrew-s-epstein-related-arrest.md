Prince Andrew was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office on his 66th birthday, following new revelations from the Justice Department's latest release of Epstein-related files, CBS News reports.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

King Charles III responded to his brother's arrest by stating that "the law must take its course," according to CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The five-word statement represents the official position of Buckingham Palace and signals that the monarchy will not seek to intervene in the legal proceedings against Andrew.

## A Measured Royal Response

The King's statement is notable for what it does and does not say. By deferring to the legal process, Charles avoided expressing personal support for his brother or casting doubt on the charges. Julian Payne, a CBS News royal contributor and former communications director for Charles when he was Prince of Wales, provided analysis of how the royal family is handling the situation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The phrase "the law must take its course" carries particular weight coming from the British sovereign. The monarch is the symbolic head of the justice system in England and Wales -- courts operate in the King's name, and prosecutions are brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. For Charles to publicly affirm that the law applies to his own brother reinforces the principle that no member of the royal family is above the legal system.

## Years of Royal Distancing

Charles's response follows years of escalating measures by the royal family to distance itself from Andrew over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped Andrew of his military titles and royal patronages after Virginia Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit alleging Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17 after being trafficked by Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Andrew settled the lawsuit the following month without admitting liability.

Andrew had already given a widely criticized BBC interview in November 2019 addressing his relationship with Epstein, which was broadly seen as damaging to the royal family's reputation. His role as the United Kingdom's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment, which he held from 2001 to 2011, is now central to the misconduct allegations, as the position gave him access to sensitive government information.

## Arrest Follows DOJ Document Release

The arrest came after the Justice Department released new Epstein-related documents that prompted UK authorities to act. Misconduct in public office is a common law offense in England and Wales that applies to public officials who willfully neglect or misconduct themselves in their duties. It can carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

[Prince Andrew's arrest](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-on-document-sharing-charges-in-epstein-case) marks the first time in modern British history that a senior member of the royal family has been taken into police custody on criminal suspicions. UK police have also been separately assessing trafficking allegations related to Epstein's use of Stansted Airport.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
