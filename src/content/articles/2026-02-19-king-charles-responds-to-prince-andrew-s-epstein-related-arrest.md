## Arrest Follows DOJ Document Release

The arrest came after the Justice Department released new Epstein-related documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The specific contents of these files that prompted the arrest have not been detailed in available reports.

Misconduct in public office is a common law offense in England and Wales that applies to public officials who willfully neglect or misconduct themselves in their duties. Andrew held various official positions and carried out royal duties on behalf of the Crown during the period in question.

[Prince Andrew's arrest](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-over-epstein-files-misconduct-claims) by UK authorities follows years of public controversy over his association with Epstein.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Andrew's Epstein Connections

Prince Andrew's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein became a source of intense public scrutiny after Epstein's 2019 arrest and subsequent death. Andrew gave a widely criticized BBC interview in November 2019 addressing his relationship with Epstein and allegations made by Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked to Andrew by Epstein when she was 17 years old.

In January 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped Andrew of his military titles and royal patronages. The following month, Andrew settled a civil lawsuit with Giuffre, though he denied all allegations of wrongdoing. The settlement amount was not publicly disclosed.

UK police have been assessing trafficking allegations related to Epstein's use of Stansted Airport, according to recent reports.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Ongoing Document Releases

The Justice Department has been releasing Epstein-related documents under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which mandated the declassification and public release of records related to Epstein's case.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The FBI has been conducting reviews of Epstein-related records as part of this process.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>
