The Epstein Transparency Act has been signed into law, directing federal agencies to collect and release records related to Jeffrey Epstein. The legislation mandates the creation of a collection of records related to Epstein's activities and requires agencies to transmit relevant records for public disclosure.

The act establishes a review process for determining which records can be released and sets timelines for their publication. Supporters of the bill argued that transparency is essential for public trust and accountability.

The legislation passed with bipartisan support, reflecting broad consensus on the need for disclosure of information related to one of the most high-profile criminal cases in recent American history.
