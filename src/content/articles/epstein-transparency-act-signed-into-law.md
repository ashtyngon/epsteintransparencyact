The Epstein Transparency Act has been signed into law on November 19, 2025, directing federal agencies to collect and release records related to Jeffrey Epstein. The legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of **427 to 1** and cleared the Senate unanimously, reflecting rare bipartisan consensus.

The bill was co-authored by **Rep. Thomas Massie** (R-KY) and **Rep. Ro Khanna** (D-CA). It advanced to a floor vote through a **discharge petition** — a procedural maneuver used to bypass committee leaders who had blocked the bill from reaching a vote. The petition gathered the required 218 signatures after sustained public pressure and grassroots advocacy.

## Modeled on the JFK Records Act

The legislation is structurally modeled on the **President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992**, which established a framework for collecting, preserving, and disclosing government records related to the Kennedy assassination. Like the JFK Act, the Epstein Transparency Act creates a dedicated collection of records and establishes review procedures for determining which documents can be released.

The act requires federal agencies — including the FBI, DOJ, CIA, and IRS — to identify and transmit all Epstein-related records to the National Archives. An independent review board will evaluate records that agencies seek to withhold, with a presumption of disclosure.

## What the Law Requires

The legislation sets specific timelines for document release and establishes penalties for non-compliance. Agencies must complete initial records transfers within 180 days of enactment. The law covers records from all federal agencies, not just law enforcement — including diplomatic communications, financial records, and intelligence assessments.

Supporters of the bill argued that transparency is essential for public trust and accountability. Victims' advocates, including representatives from organizations like RAINN and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, testified before Congress in support of the legislation.

The sole "no" vote in the House came from **Rep. John Duarte** (R-CA), who cited concerns about privacy protections for individuals not charged with crimes.
