**Kathy Ruemmler**, the chief legal officer at **Goldman Sachs** and former White House counsel under **Barack Obama**, announced her resignation on **Thursday, February 12, 2026**, following the revelation of emails showing close ties to convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**. The emails show Ruemmler referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey."

The resignation marks another high-profile professional consequence stemming from associations with Epstein, whose network of contacts continues to generate public scrutiny years after his death. Ruemmler's departure from one of Wall Street's most prominent firms underscores the ongoing reputational risks for individuals connected to the disgraced financier.

## Ruemmler's Statement and Timeline

Ruemmler said in a statement on Thursday that she would "step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of **June 30, 2026**," according to The Guardian. The announcement comes directly after emails surfaced revealing her relationship with Epstein.

## Email Revelations Show "Uncle Jeffrey" Reference

The emails demonstrate what The Guardian describes as "close ties" between Ruemmler and Epstein, the convicted sexual abuser who died in 2019 while awaiting federal sex trafficking charges. The specific content of the emails beyond the "Uncle Jeffrey" reference has not been detailed in available reporting.

## Background on Ruemmler's Career

Before joining Goldman Sachs, Ruemmler served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, one of the most senior legal positions in the executive branch. Her departure from Goldman Sachs will take effect in approximately four months, though it remains unclear whether she will remain in her role until the stated departure date or take immediate leave.

The timing and circumstances of how the emails came to light has not been specified in available reports.
