# Bill Clinton Gives Closed-Door Deposition in House Epstein Investigation

**Former President Bill Clinton** testified Friday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in New York as part of its investigation into convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**, marking the first time a former U.S. president has been deposed by Congress in such a probe.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The closed-door deposition comes one day after **Hillary Clinton** testified before the same committee, during which she stated she had "no idea" about Epstein's crimes.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> During her Thursday testimony, Hillary Clinton criticized questions that veered off topic from the Epstein investigation.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The consecutive depositions of both Clintons represent a significant development in the House committee's ongoing examination of the late financier's criminal network and the extent of his connections to prominent political figures.

## Investigation Focuses on Clinton-Epstein Connection

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been examining Bill Clinton's relationship with Epstein as part of its broader investigation into the convicted sex offender's activities. Sky News reported that it has uncovered previously unknown details about the relationship between Clinton and Epstein, though the specific findings were not detailed in available reports.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Clinton's deposition in New York follows months of scrutiny over his documented association with Epstein. The closed-door format of the testimony means the specific questions posed to Clinton and his responses remain undisclosed to the public.

The timing of the depositions has drawn criticism from some observers. **France 24** characterized the Clinton hearings as "political theatre to distract public from Trump," suggesting the proceedings may be designed to shift attention away from other aspects of the Epstein investigation.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## Historic Nature of Testimony

Clinton's appearance before the House committee represents an unprecedented moment in congressional oversight. Never before has a former president been called to testify before Congress specifically as part of an investigation into a convicted sex offender's criminal network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The historic nature of the deposition underscores the seriousness with which congressional investigators are treating the Epstein case. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has jurisdiction over matters involving potential government oversight failures and connections between public officials and criminal enterprises.

Both Clintons' willingness to participate in closed-door depositions, rather than invoking executive privilege or other legal protections, indicates their cooperation with the congressional investigation. However, the closed-door format means transparency advocates and the public have limited access to the substance of their testimony.

## Hillary Clinton's Thursday Testimony

During her Thursday deposition, Hillary Clinton stated she had "no idea" about Epstein's crimes, according to reports summarizing her testimony.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The former Secretary of State also pushed back against certain lines of questioning that she believed strayed from the investigation's core focus on Epstein.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The specific questions Hillary Clinton deemed off-topic were not disclosed in public reports. The closed-door nature of both depositions means the full scope of the committee's inquiries and the Clintons' responses remain known only to committee members and their staff.

The back-to-back depositions of the former presidential couple signal the committee's interest in understanding what knowledge, if any, they had of Epstein's criminal activities and the nature of any interactions they may have had with him.

## Broader Context of Epstein Investigation

Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor. He died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His longtime associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted in December 2021 on charges including sex trafficking of minors.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's investigation represents one of several ongoing efforts to examine Epstein's connections and the potential failures of law enforcement and other institutions to stop his crimes. The investigation has already resulted in multiple high-profile depositions, with the Clintons being among the most prominent figures called to testify.

The committee has not announced a timeline for completing its investigation or releasing any findings. With testimony continuing to be taken in closed-door sessions, the public may not learn the full scope of what investigators have uncovered until the committee chooses to issue a formal report or hold public hearings.
