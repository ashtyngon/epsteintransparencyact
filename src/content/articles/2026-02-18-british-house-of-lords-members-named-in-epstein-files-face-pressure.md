Fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein files has reached Britain's House of Lords, according to PBS NewsHour.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

PBS NewsHour reported that "fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein files has landed on the gilded wood and plush red benches of Britain's House of Lords."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The report did not identify which members were named in the documents or specify what allegations the files contained.

The House of Lords is the upper chamber of the British Parliament. It includes appointed life peers, bishops, and hereditary peers who review and revise legislation passed by the elected House of Commons.

## UK Investigations and Political Fallout

[Congress subpoenaed Lord Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe), a member of the House of Lords, over his ties to Epstein.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Mandelson served as a Cabinet minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before being appointed to the Lords as Baron Mandelson in 2008.

UK police launched a national task force to investigate Epstein trafficking allegations.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Britain's top prosecutor stated that "nobody is above the law" as police probed Prince Andrew, though Andrew is not a member of the House of Lords.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

European police opened new investigations following revelations in the Epstein files.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> French prosecutors announced two separate Epstein-related probes in February 2026 and called for victims to file complaints.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## Document Releases

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in 2025, requires federal agencies to review and publicly release documents related to Epstein within 180 days, with limited exceptions for national security and ongoing investigations.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

A federal court in New York previously unsealed documents from a 2015 defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup> Those documents named numerous individuals who had contact with Epstein, though being named does not indicate wrongdoing.

Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on sex trafficking charges and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup> Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.
