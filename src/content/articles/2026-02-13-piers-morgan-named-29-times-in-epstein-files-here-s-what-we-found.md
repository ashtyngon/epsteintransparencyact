## Morgan's Response

Morgan has disputed the reports about his name appearing in Epstein-related documents, according to BuzzFeed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

BuzzFeed titled its article "Piers Morgan Wouldn't Accept His Name Is In The Epstein Files" and published a breakdown of all 29 mentions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Other Media Figures in the Files

Morgan is not the only media personality whose name appears in the files. [Joe Rogan's name surfaced](/news/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-epstein-files-scare-the-hell-out-of-me) in a 2017 email exchange where Epstein asked physicist Lawrence Krauss to introduce him to Rogan; Krauss tried but Rogan never responded, and no meeting occurred.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Rogan publicly acknowledged the mention and explained he declined after looking up Epstein online.

The two responses represent different approaches by public figures whose names appear in the documents. Rogan acknowledged the mention and provided full context. Morgan has disputed the reports.

## Being Named in the Files

Being named in the files does not itself constitute evidence of wrongdoing. Epstein maintained extensive records of contacts, communications, and social connections across media, finance, politics, and academia.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The DOJ has released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos under the Epstein Transparency Act, which passed the House 427-1, passed the Senate unanimously, and was signed into law on November 19, 2025.

For comparison, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem of DP World appeared more than 4,700 times in the files and subsequently left his position as CEO.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

BuzzFeed has published the full breakdown. The documents are publicly available. Morgan continues to dispute the reports.
