British broadcaster **Piers Morgan** appears **29 times** in newly released Epstein files, according to a breakdown published by BuzzFeed. Morgan has refused to accept that his name appears in the documents.

The tally contradicts Morgan's public posture on the files. BuzzFeed's analysis documents each instance where Morgan's name surfaces in the materials released under the Epstein Transparency Act, providing a direct challenge to his denials.

## Morgan's Response

Morgan has built a career interrogating public figures on television. His response to his own name appearing nearly three dozen times in Epstein-related documents has been to dispute the reports.

BuzzFeed titled its investigation "Piers Morgan Wouldn't Accept His Name Is In The Epstein Files." The outlet published a detailed breakdown of all 29 mentions.

## A Pattern Across Media Figures

Morgan isn't the only media personality grappling with appearances in the files. [Joe Rogan recently addressed his own name surfacing in the documents](/articles/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-epstein-files-scare-the-hell-out-of-me), taking a different approach by acknowledging the mention and providing context.

The two responses illustrate different approaches by public figures confronted with their documented proximity to Epstein's network. Rogan acknowledged the mention and provided context. Morgan has disputed the reports.

## What 29 Mentions Mean

Being named in the files doesn't itself prove wrongdoing. Epstein's operation kept extensive records of contacts, communications, and social connections across media, finance, politics, and academia. The DOJ has released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos under the Epstein Transparency Act, which passed the House 427-1, passed the Senate unanimously, and was signed into law on November 19, 2025.

Twenty-nine mentions across the documents indicate multiple points of contact within the networks Epstein maintained and documented. For comparison, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem of DP World appeared more than 4,700 times in the files and was subsequently forced out as CEO.

BuzzFeed has published the full breakdown. The documents are public. Morgan continues to dispute the reports.
