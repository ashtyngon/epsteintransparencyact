British broadcaster **Piers Morgan** appears **29 times** in newly released Epstein files, according to a breakdown published by BuzzFeed. Morgan has refused to accept that his name appears in the documents.

The tally contradicts Morgan's public posture on the files. BuzzFeed's analysis documents each instance where Morgan's name surfaces in the materials released under the Epstein Transparency Act, providing a direct challenge to his denials.

## Morgan's Response

Morgan has built a career interrogating public figures who dodge uncomfortable questions. His response to his own name appearing nearly three dozen times in Epstein-related documents has been to simply reject the premise.

BuzzFeed titled its investigation "Piers Morgan Wouldn't Accept His Name Is In The Epstein Files," signaling that Morgan's denial contradicts the documentary record. The outlet published a detailed breakdown of all 29 mentions.

## A Pattern Across Media Figures

Morgan isn't the only media personality grappling with appearances in the files. [Joe Rogan recently addressed his own name surfacing in the documents](/articles/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-addresses-name-in-epstein-files-release), taking a different approach by acknowledging the mention and providing context.

The contrast highlights how public figures are choosing divergent strategies when confronted with their documented proximity to Epstein's network. Some explain. Others deny. Morgan has chosen denial.

## What 29 Mentions Mean

Being named in the files doesn't itself prove wrongdoing. Epstein's operation kept extensive records of contacts, communications, and social connections across media, finance, politics, and academia. 

But 29 mentions isn't incidental contact. That frequency suggests repeated interactions or sustained presence within networks Epstein maintained and documented.

The Epstein Transparency Act has made millions of pages public specifically so that the extent of these networks can be examined. Morgan spent years demanding transparency from others. These 29 documented mentions are now his transparency test.

BuzzFeed has published the breakdown. The documents are public. Morgan's refusal to accept what the files show doesn't make the mentions disappear.
