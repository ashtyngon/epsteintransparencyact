British broadcaster **Piers Morgan** is named 29 times in newly released Epstein files, according to BuzzFeed, which published a detailed breakdown of every mention in the documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Morgan has vehemently denied the reports.

## What the Documents Show

BuzzFeed's analysis cataloged each of the 29 instances where Morgan's name appears in the trove of more than 3 million pages released by the Department of Justice.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The mentions appear in emails and communications between **Jeffrey Epstein** and his associates, not in correspondence authored by Morgan himself.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> In one example, an Epstein associate emailed the financier about having been at a dinner with Morgan.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

One document appears to definitively clear Morgan of legal involvement. In an exchange between two FBI agents, Morgan's name was listed as "no hit," indicating agents found no actionable connection to Epstein's criminal conduct.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Morgan's On-Air Denial

Morgan was first informed that his name appeared in the files during a taping of his YouTube show "Uncensored," according to BuzzFeed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He vehemently denied his name was present, telling the program: "The only connection I've ever had to either of them, as I've said many times, is I met **Ghislaine Maxwell** for five minutes at a book launch in New York."<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The confrontation resurfaced on the Feb. 19 episode of "Piers Morgan Uncensored," when internet streamer **Braden Clavicular** asked Morgan whether he wished to apologize for appearing in the files. Morgan responded: "You can go read...the Epstein files. You can go and check my name. You can read every entry...You'll see none of them have anything to do with him or his activities or anything."<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Other Media Figures Named

Morgan is not the only media personality whose name appears in the documents. [**Joe Rogan**'s name surfaced](/news/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-epstein-files-scare-the-hell-out-of-me) in a 2017 email exchange in which Epstein asked physicist Lawrence Krauss to arrange an introduction; Krauss attempted the connection, but Rogan never responded, and no meeting occurred.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Rogan publicly acknowledged the mention and said he declined after researching Epstein online.

The two responses illustrate contrasting approaches by public figures named in the documents. Rogan acknowledged his mention and provided context. Morgan has disputed the reports entirely.

## Context: Being Named vs. Being Implicated

Being named in the files does not constitute evidence of wrongdoing. Epstein maintained extensive records of contacts, communications and social connections across media, finance, politics and academia.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The DOJ released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos under the Epstein Transparency Act, which passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously before President **Donald Trump** signed it into law on Nov. 19, 2025.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

The scale of the document release means thousands of individuals appear by name, many incidentally. Among those mentioned most frequently: Epstein's assistant Lesley Groff (157,613 mentions), accountant Richard Kahn (52,781), Trump and his wife Melania Trump (more than 38,000 references) and Ghislaine Maxwell (13,169).<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

**Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem** of DP World appeared more than 4,700 times and subsequently [resigned from his position](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> Morgan's 29 mentions represent a comparatively minor presence in a document set of this magnitude.

The documents are publicly available through the [DOJ's Epstein Library](https://www.justice.gov/epstein). Morgan continues to dispute the reports.
