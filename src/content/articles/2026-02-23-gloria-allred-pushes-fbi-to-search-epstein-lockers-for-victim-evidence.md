**Gloria Allred**, the prominent victims' rights attorney, has called on the **FBI** to search safety deposit boxes reportedly belonging to **Jeffrey Epstein** for the benefit of his victims, according to **The Telegraph**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Allred's appeal comes as evidence suggests Epstein maintained [hidden storage units across the United States](/news/2026-02-23-epstein-secret-storage-units-across-us-contain-unreleased-evidence) that may contain unreleased materials relevant to the investigation into his sex trafficking operation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The attorney, who has represented numerous victims of high-profile abusers, directed her statement specifically to federal investigators regarding lockers believed to be associated with the late financier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Storage Units and Evidence Collection

The existence of Epstein's safety deposit boxes and storage facilities has been a subject of growing interest in the ongoing investigation. [The Telegraph previously reported](/news/2026-02-22-telegraph-reports-epstein-hidden-storage-units-across-us) that Epstein maintained storage units in multiple locations, potentially containing documents, recordings, or other materials that could identify additional victims or co-conspirators.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Allred's public call to the FBI underscores advocates' concerns that not all available evidence has been examined or made available to victims seeking accountability.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The FBI's investigation into Epstein's criminal network has continued even after his August 2019 death while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in a Manhattan jail cell. Federal authorities have worked to identify additional victims and potential co-conspirators.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Allred's Advocacy for Victims

Allred has built a career representing victims of sexual abuse and misconduct in high-profile cases. Her involvement in cases related to Epstein and his associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** has made her a prominent voice advocating for victim accountability and transparency in the investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor under a controversial plea agreement that allowed him to serve only 13 months in a county jail work-release program. That lenient deal became the subject of intense scrutiny after federal prosecutors in New York charged him in 2019 with operating a vast sex trafficking network targeting underage girls.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Compensation and Ongoing Legal Efforts

Epstein's vast wealth and properties across multiple jurisdictions have complicated efforts to catalog his assets and locate potential evidence. His estates in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have all been subjects of investigation and legal proceedings related to victim compensation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Victims' Compensation Fund, established in 2020, processed claims from individuals who alleged abuse by Epstein before ceasing operations in 2021.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Allred's appeal to the FBI underscores the continuing efforts by victims' advocates to ensure that all available evidence is examined and that potential victims who have not yet come forward are given the opportunity to seek justice.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
