**Elon Musk** once asked **Jeffrey Epstein** to arrange "the wildest party" he could organize, according to **The Washington Post**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The request came in communications between the two men that have not been previously reported in detail.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Washington Post reported the existence of the communication in which Musk made the party request to Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The outlet did not provide additional details about when the request was made or whether such a party took place.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The disclosure comes as Musk has made public statements about the Epstein case in recent months.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The billionaire entrepreneur, who leads Tesla and SpaceX, has called for greater transparency regarding those connected to the convicted sex offender on social media platforms.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Epstein's Criminal History

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Federal prosecutors accused him of operating a sex trafficking ring that recruited and abused dozens of underage girls at his residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.

He died in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York on August 10, 2019, while awaiting trial.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging.

The 2019 arrest came more than a decade after Epstein's initial conviction. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He served 13 months in a county jail under a work-release program that allowed him to leave custody for up to 12 hours a day, six days a week.

That 2008 plea deal was negotiated with federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida. The arrangement faced intense criticism because it allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges and did not require him to cooperate with authorities in identifying possible co-conspirators.

## Epstein's Network of Contacts

Epstein cultivated relationships with numerous wealthy and powerful individuals over several decades.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His contacts included business leaders, politicians, scientists, and celebrities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Documents released through court proceedings and Freedom of Information Act requests have revealed previously unknown contacts between Epstein and prominent individuals.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Musk's communication with Epstein adds to the list of business and technology leaders known to have had contact with the financier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The extent and nature of Epstein's relationships with various public figures has been a subject of ongoing scrutiny and investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The disclosure comes at a time when public pressure for transparency about Epstein's network remains high.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Washington Post did not report whether Musk had responded to questions about the communication or provided context for the request.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
