Private emails between Jeffrey Epstein and business leaders, academics, and public figures have spread across Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook in recent weeks, with screenshots of court documents circulating widely, according to NBC News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The posts often lacked context about the nature of the communications.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

A calendar entry for a canceled meeting generated similar engagement to emails discussing financial transactions or travel arrangements. The emails emerged through court cases brought by Epstein's victims, which forced the unsealing of documents including correspondence, flight logs, and calendars.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## From Court Files to Social Media

After courts ordered releases, journalists and researchers downloaded the files, typically PDF scans of emails and schedules. News organizations identified individuals who corresponded with Epstein. Social media users then amplified specific names and excerpts.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously and was signed into law on November 19, 2025, mandated the release of 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos of FBI documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The [New York Times launched an investigation](/news/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) to analyze the files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Some names appeared in mundane contexts -- calendar entries for canceled meetings or forwarded newsletter subscriptions. Other emails detailed financial relationships or frequent contact. Social media algorithms surfaced both categories based on engagement rather than the substance of the association.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Redactions and Misinformation

The [FBI has maintained redactions](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) in documents released under the transparency law, citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Attorney General Bondi faced congressional questioning about the extent of redactions and the criteria for withholding names.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Several viral social media posts traced back to fabricated documents that mimicked the formatting of authentic court releases, according to NBC News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Departures Following Releases

Kathryn Ruemmler, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel;<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO of Dubai's DP World who appeared 4,700+ times in the files;<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> and Casey Wasserman, LA 2028 Olympics chairman,<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> all departed their positions after their names surfaced in released documents.

Most social media posts about the emails did not link to source documents or specify whether the contact occurred before or after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Palm Beach County for soliciting prostitution from a minor -- a plea deal negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
