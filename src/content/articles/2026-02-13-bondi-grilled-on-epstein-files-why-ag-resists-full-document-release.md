Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a contentious House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday over the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files. She now faces criticism from within her own party.

Conservative media outlets and MAGA-aligned commentators are now criticizing Bondi over her testimony, in which she sparred with lawmakers pressing for full release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's network. The hearing, [first reported by The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5737123-bondi-sparks-outrage-epstein/), has prompted criticism from conservative commentators who previously supported her nomination.

## The Base Wanted a Reformer

Bondi was sold as the Attorney General who would finally expose the Epstein network after years of Republican promises. Instead, she spent Wednesday [defending DOJ's approach](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) while lawmakers demanded answers about why names remain redacted and disclosure remains slow.

Bondi's defense of DOJ's approach contrasted with earlier Republican calls for transparency—especially after [President Trump called for an end to the Epstein investigation](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) days earlier. Conservative commentators who had expected Bondi to champion transparency now accuse her of protecting establishment figures.

## The Files Continue Prompting Resignations

While Bondi defended the department's pace, the files themselves continue generating fallout in the private sector. [Kathryn Ruemmler, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after emails surfaced showing she referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey." Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem stepped down as chair and CEO of DP World after appearing more than 4,700 times in the files.

Corporations have acted within days of document releases, while DOJ has maintained a slower pace on disclosure. The department was also recently found to have been tracking which lawmakers search the Epstein files.

## Congress Moves Faster Than Justice

The hearing underscored a widening gap between congressional Republicans demanding transparency and an administration increasingly hesitant about where the documents lead. When a congressman stood on the House floor and named six individuals still hidden in redacted files, it made clear: lawmakers are moving faster than the department supposedly investigating.

Bondi now faces political pressure from both sides. Congressional Republicans are demanding faster disclosure, while the administration has signaled hesitance about where the documents lead.

Bondi promised accountability during her confirmation. She is now facing criticism from conservative media over Epstein transparency, placing her in a difficult position. The files remain partially released, and calls for full disclosure continue.
