Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a hostile House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday over the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files—and left to an unexpected problem: her own side turning against her.

Conservative media outlets and MAGA-aligned commentators are now attacking Bondi over her testimony, in which she sparred with lawmakers pressing for full release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's network. The contentious hearing, [first reported by The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5737123-bondi-sparks-outrage-epstein/), has ignited a backlash from the same right-wing ecosystem that championed her nomination.

## The Base Wanted a Reformer

Bondi was sold as the Attorney General who would finally expose the Epstein network after years of Republican promises. Instead, she spent Wednesday [defending DOJ's approach](/articles/2026-02-13-house-judiciary-grills-ag-over-growing-epstein-connections) while lawmakers demanded answers about why names remain redacted and disclosure remains slow.

The performance clashed sharply with what the MAGA base expected—especially after [President Trump called for an end to the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) days earlier. Conservative commentators who expected Bondi to champion transparency now accuse her of protecting establishment figures.

## The Files Keep Producing Casualties—Just Not From DOJ

While Bondi defended the department's pace, the files themselves continue generating fallout in the private sector. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-secret-epstein-ties-revealed-in-emails) after the documents exposed his connections. [A Dubai ports CEO was forced out](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties) when emails surfaced. [A billionaire executive stepped down](/articles/2026-02-13-billionaire-ceo-resigns-after-epstein-connection-exposed) under pressure.

The contrast is stark: corporations are acting within days, while DOJ drags its feet on disclosure. Worse, the department was recently caught [tracking which lawmakers search the Epstein files](/articles/2026-02-13-doj-tracking-lawmaker-epstein-file-searches-bondi-document-reveals)—a revelation that deepened distrust.

## Congress Moves Faster Than Justice

The hearing underscored a widening gap between congressional Republicans demanding transparency and an administration increasingly hesitant about where the documents lead. When [a congressman stood on the House floor and named six individuals still hidden in redacted files](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-on-house-floor), it made clear: lawmakers are moving faster than the department supposedly investigating.

Bondi now faces the political consequences. She can continue defending DOJ's cautious approach and risk alienating the base that expected reform. Or she can accelerate disclosure and expose powerful figures who may have allies in her own party—or the administration she serves.

For an Attorney General who promised accountability, getting attacked by conservative media over Epstein transparency is a dangerous position. And as long as the files remain partially hidden, the backlash isn't going away.
