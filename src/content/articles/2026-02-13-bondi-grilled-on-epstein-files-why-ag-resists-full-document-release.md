Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday over the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She now faces criticism from within her own party.

Conservative media outlets and MAGA-aligned commentators have criticized Bondi over her testimony, in which she responded to lawmakers pressing for full release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The hearing has prompted criticism from conservative commentators who previously supported her nomination, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Bondi's Testimony

Bondi spent Wednesday [defending DOJ's approach](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) while lawmakers demanded answers about why names remain redacted and disclosure remains slow.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Bondi's defense of DOJ's approach contrasted with earlier Republican calls for transparency, particularly after [President Trump called for an end to the Epstein investigation](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) days earlier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Resignations Following File Releases

While Bondi testified, the files continued generating fallout in the private sector. [Kathryn Ruemmler, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after emails surfaced showing she referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey," according to Axios.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem stepped down as chair and CEO of DP World after appearing more than 4,700 times in the files, according to CBS News.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Corporations acted within days of document releases, while DOJ has maintained a slower pace on disclosure. The department was also reported to have been tracking which lawmakers search the Epstein files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Pressure

The hearing underscored a gap between congressional Republicans demanding transparency and an administration that has moved cautiously on further releases. A congressman stood on the House floor and named six individuals whose names remain redacted in the official files.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Bondi faces political pressure from both sides. Congressional Republicans are demanding faster disclosure, while the administration has signaled caution about where the documents lead.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The files remain partially released, and calls for full disclosure continue from both parties.
