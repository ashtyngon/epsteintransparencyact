Attorney General **Pam Bondi** faced roughly five hours of combative questioning before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday over the Justice Department's handling of the **Jeffrey Epstein** files, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The hearing produced sharp exchanges with lawmakers from both parties and triggered criticism from conservative commentators who had previously supported her nomination.

## The Hearing

Bondi defended the DOJ's approach to releasing the 3.5 million pages of Epstein documents mandated under the Transparency Act, while lawmakers demanded answers about why names remain redacted and disclosure has been slow.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The testimony contrasted with earlier Republican calls for transparency, particularly after [President Trump called for an end to the Epstein investigation](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) days earlier.

In one exchange, **Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.)** accused Bondi of refusing to answer his questions, according to NPR.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Bondi and **Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)**, who helped advance the legislation that forced the file release, also clashed. Massie told Bondi the DOJ had committed the worst possible offense against survivors by releasing victims' personal information through inconsistent redactions, according to NBC News.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Bondi accused Massie of fixating on the files because President Trump was mentioned in them.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## Redaction Failures

Democrats pressed Bondi over what the Associated Press and other news organizations found were inconsistent redactions that exposed intimate details about victims, including photographs, while the names of Epstein's associates remained hidden, according to NPR.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Bondi told lawmakers the department had taken down files when errors were identified and that staff had done their "very best" given the volume and timeline imposed by the legislation.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Bondi directly addressed Epstein survivors present at the hearing. **Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)** asked survivors in the room to stand if they had not been able to meet with DOJ about the abuse they faced; every victim raised their hand, according to PBS NewsHour.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

## DOJ Surveillance Revelation

The hearing also revealed that the DOJ had been [tracking which lawmakers searched the Epstein files](/news/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches), raising constitutional concerns. Jayapal said Bondi arrived at the hearing with a printed log of her search history from the files, according to NBC News.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>

## Conservative Backlash

The testimony fractured Bondi's support among MAGA-aligned media figures. Conservative radio host **Erick Erickson** wrote on X that Bondi should be "fired or resign" after she deflected a question about prosecutions by discussing the stock market, according to Axios.<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup> **Megyn Kelly** said Bondi had "humiliated" conservative commentators who had promoted the prospect of a "client list" release, while **Alex Jones** said the hearing proved "the swamp" was winning, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Rep. Massie** later said he had [lost confidence in Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over her handling of the files.

## Resignations During the Hearing

While Bondi testified, the files continued generating fallout in the private sector. [**Kathryn Ruemmler**, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after emails surfaced in the documents, according to Axios.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> [**Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem** stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) as chairman and CEO of DP World after appearing more than 4,700 times in the files, according to CBS News.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Congressional Pressure

The hearing underscored a gap between congressional Republicans demanding transparency and an administration that has moved cautiously on further releases. A [lawmaker named six individuals](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) from the House floor whose names remain redacted in the official releases.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The files remain partially released, and calls for full disclosure continue from both parties.
