## Chopra's Public Profile

Chopra has built a career as an author and speaker on topics including meditation, Ayurvedic medicine, and spirituality. He founded the Chopra Foundation and co-founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing. He has written dozens of books and has been a fixture in American alternative medicine circles since the 1990s.

## Context of Document Releases

The DOJ has been releasing batches of Epstein-related files following the enactment of federal transparency legislation. The [Epstein Transparency Act was signed into law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) earlier this year, requiring federal agencies to declassify and make public records related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates.

The [FBI began its review of Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the new law, with multiple agencies conducting systematic searches of their files for responsive documents. The release of documents has triggered [global resignations and new investigations](/news/2026-02-23-doj-epstein-files-release-sparks-global-resignations-new-probes) as names of previously unknown associates have emerged in the files.

[Engineers have built tools to help the public search the Epstein files](/news/2026-02-23-engineers-build-tools-to-help-public-search-epstein-files) as the volume of released materials grows.

## Epstein's Network

The document releases have revealed the extent of Epstein's contact with figures across multiple industries, including academia, business, entertainment, and politics. Previous disclosures have shown Epstein maintained relationships with scientists, executives, and public figures, often positioning himself as a philanthropist and financier despite his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His former associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges related to her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse.

The newly released DOJ files continue to shed light on the scope of Epstein's network of contacts. Public interest groups and journalists have been systematically reviewing the documents as they become available.

The DOJ has not announced a timeline for completing the release of all Epstein-related documents in its possession.
