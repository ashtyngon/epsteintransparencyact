The Department of Justice has launched an internal review to determine whether any records related to Jeffrey Epstein were withheld from Congress, The Hill reported Thursday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The review comes after reports that documents concerning former President Donald Trump may be missing from the materials released under the Epstein Transparency Act.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The review follows concerns raised by members of Congress about the completeness of the document production.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2025, required federal agencies to declassify and release records related to the Epstein case within specific timeframes.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

According to The Hill, the DOJ is examining its compliance with the law's disclosure requirements, particularly whether any Trump-related documents were excluded from the release.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The review will assess the department's processes for identifying, categorizing, and producing responsive records to Congress.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Allegations of Excluded Materials

Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) [stated earlier this week](/news/2026-02-24-rep-garcia-doj-withheld-fbi-interviews-with-trump-accuser-in-epstein-files) that FBI interviews with a Trump accuser were withheld from the files released to Congress.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Garcia's allegations have prompted scrutiny of whether other materials may have been excluded from the production.

The Epstein Transparency Act passed the House of Representatives in December 2024 by a vote of 382-42 and the Senate unanimously before being signed into law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The legislation established strict deadlines for agencies to review their files and produce relevant documents to designated congressional committees.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Federal agencies were required to conduct comprehensive searches of their records systems and provide certifications of completeness to Congress.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The law included provisions for classified materials to be reviewed in secure settings while still being made available to authorized lawmakers.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## DOJ Document Production Process

The FBI began its formal review of Epstein-related records in January 2025 following the law's enactment.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Multiple agencies, including the Department of Justice and FBI, were tasked with identifying responsive materials in their possession.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The internal DOJ review announced Thursday represents the first public acknowledgment by the department that questions have been raised about the completeness of its production.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He had been convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in a plea deal that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution at that time.

The current review focuses on whether the DOJ's document production to Congress satisfied the requirements of the Epstein Transparency Act and whether any records were excluded from the release.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Congressional committees continue to examine the materials that have been produced while awaiting the results of the department's internal assessment.

The DOJ has not publicly commented on the specific allegations regarding Trump-related documents or provided details about the scope of materials under review.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The timeline for completing the review has not been disclosed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
