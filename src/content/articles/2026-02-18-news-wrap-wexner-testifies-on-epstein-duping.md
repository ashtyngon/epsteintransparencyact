Billionaire **Les Wexner** told lawmakers Wednesday he was "duped by a world-class con-man" as he faced questions about his association with **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to PBS NewsHour.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The [testimony before Congress](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony) marked Wexner's first public congressional appearance to address his relationship with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The billionaire founder of L Brands, formerly the parent company of Victoria's Secret, characterized himself as a victim of Epstein's deception.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner's remarks came during a congressional hearing focused on his decades-long financial and personal ties to Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The testimony occurred on the same day the National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya was announced as acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the FDA reversed its decision regarding approval consideration for a new mRNA flu shot from Moderna.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

[Democrats expressed skepticism](/news/2026-02-18-leslie-wexner-says-epstein-conned-him-but-democrats-are-skeptical) about Wexner's claims during the hearing, according to separate reporting on the testimony.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Congress [subpoenaed Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) earlier this month to compel his appearance before the panel investigating Epstein's network of associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The hearing represents part of ongoing congressional efforts to investigate individuals and institutions connected to Epstein following passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, which mandated federal agencies review and release records related to the sex trafficking case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
