# Goldman Sachs General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler Resigns Over Epstein Ties

**Kathryn Ruemmler**, general counsel at **Goldman Sachs** and former top lawyer in the Obama administration, has resigned following revelations of a years-long friendship with convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to the **New York Times**. Emails disclosed the relationship spanned multiple years.

The resignation marks one of the highest-profile corporate departures tied to Epstein connections since his 2019 arrest and death. Ruemmler served as White House Counsel under President Obama from 2011 to 2014 before joining Goldman Sachs as general counsel.

## Emails Document Friendship with Jeffrey Epstein

According to the New York Times, emails revealed Ruemmler maintained a friendship with Epstein over many years. The nature and extent of the communications prompted her departure from the Wall Street firm.

Goldman Sachs has not publicly commented on the specific contents of the emails or the timeline of when the firm became aware of Ruemmler's Epstein connections.

## Former White House Counsel's Corporate Role

Ruemmler held one of the most senior legal positions at Goldman Sachs, overseeing the firm's global legal affairs. Her background included serving as one of the lead prosecutors in the **Enron** case before joining the Obama administration.

Her resignation comes as public scrutiny continues over individuals and institutions connected to Epstein, who died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

## Transparency Pressure Continues

The disclosure follows ongoing calls for transparency regarding Epstein's network of associates in business, politics, and academia. The **Epstein Transparency Act**, proposed federal legislation, seeks to compel release of sealed documents related to the financier's criminal activities and associates.

Multiple organizations and individuals have faced pressure to disclose the nature and extent of their relationships with Epstein following years of court document releases and investigative reporting.
