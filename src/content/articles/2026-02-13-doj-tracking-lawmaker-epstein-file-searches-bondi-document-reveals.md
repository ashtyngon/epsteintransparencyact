A photograph of Attorney General Pam Bondi carrying a document that appears to track Rep. Pramila Jayapal's searches of Epstein files has triggered immediate questions about whether the Justice Department is surveilling congressional oversight activities.

The document, visible in images captured this week, seemingly lists the Washington Democrat's search history of the records. No explanation has been offered for why such tracking exists or what purpose it serves.

## Why DOJ Would Monitor Congress

Members of Congress routinely access sensitive materials as part of their constitutional oversight function. The existence of a document logging which files a lawmaker reviewed suggests the Justice Department is creating records of those inquiries—a practice legal observers say could suppress legitimate investigation.

Jayapal has been vocal in demanding full transparency in the Epstein case. The document's appearance comes as [the Trump DOJ faces accusations of covering up portions of the files](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) through heavy redactions, and after President Trump himself [called for ending the Epstein investigation entirely](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation).

Bondi has already faced [direct questioning from lawmakers](/articles/2026-02-13-ag-questioned-on-epstein-files-release) about the department's handling of the files. She offered no details about how redaction decisions were made or who was being protected.

## "Creepy"

Social media users seized on the image, with "creepy" trending in response to the photograph. The criticism focused less on the document's existence than on Bondi's decision to carry it in public view—turning congressional oversight activity into visible surveillance.

The Justice Department has not responded to questions about the document. Bondi's office has not clarified whether similar tracking exists for other lawmakers or explained the legal basis for monitoring congressional file access.

## Chilling Effect

The photograph surfaced as [Congress moves to compel testimony from key Epstein associate Leslie Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and other figures. Lawmakers conducting that investigation now face the prospect that their research is being logged by the same Justice Department they're investigating.

Former prosecutors questioned both why such records would be created and why the Attorney General would transport them openly. The incident reveals either sloppy handling of sensitive tracking data or a deliberate signal that congressional oversight is being watched.

Neither explanation suggests a Justice Department interested in facilitating transparency. Both suggest lawmakers asking questions about Epstein's network are being treated as subjects of interest rather than constitutional overseers.

The DOJ's silence on the document leaves open whether this monitoring is widespread or targeted—and whether Congress will accept a Justice Department that surveils the investigators.
