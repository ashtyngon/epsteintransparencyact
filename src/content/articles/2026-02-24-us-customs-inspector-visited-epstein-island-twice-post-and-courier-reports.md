A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspector who worked at the Port of Charleston traveled twice to Jeffrey Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the Post and Courier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The newspaper identified the former inspector but did not provide details about the timing of the visits, the inspector's current employment status, or whether the trips occurred before or after Epstein's 2008 conviction on state charges of soliciting a minor.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The inspector's position at the Port of Charleston would have involved screening cargo and travelers entering the United States through one of the Southeast's major shipping hubs.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Federal Law Enforcement Connection

The Post and Courier did not report whether the inspector faced disciplinary action or whether the agency investigated the trips.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Customs and Border Protection officers hold positions of significant authority, including the ability to inspect cargo, detain travelers, and access sensitive databases. Federal employees are subject to ethics rules that restrict gifts and travel from individuals who may have business before their agencies.

The revelation comes as [federal investigators examine Epstein's relationships with multiple U.S. Customs officers](/news/2026-02-19-epstein-cultivated-ties-to-u-s-customs-officers-triggering-criminal-probe), according to prior reporting.

## Epstein's Island Operations

Epstein owned Little St. James Island, a 70-acre property in the U.S. Virgin Islands that became central to allegations of sex trafficking. Court documents and witness testimony described the island as a location where Epstein abused underage girls.

Following Epstein's arrest in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges, prosecutors alleged he used the island to transport victims and conduct illegal activity. Flight logs from Epstein's private jets showed hundreds of trips to the island between the 1990s and his 2019 arrest.

Epstein died by suicide in August 2019 in a Manhattan federal jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.

The Post and Courier's reporting did not indicate whether federal investigators have interviewed the former inspector or whether the trips are under review as part of ongoing inquiries.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
