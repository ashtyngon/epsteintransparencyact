## Epstein Case Background

Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida of soliciting a minor, serving 13 months in a work-release program.

His associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence in federal custody.

Epstein maintained connections in the United Kingdom over several decades. Flight logs and witness testimony placed numerous prominent British figures on his private aircraft or at his properties.

Maxwell, who holds British citizenship, facilitated many of Epstein's UK connections. Her trial in New York federal court heard testimony about how she recruited and groomed young women for abuse by Epstein and his associates.

## International Investigations Continue

The UK investigation represents one of several international probes into Epstein's network. [France launched a diplomatic inquiry](/news/2026-02-23-france-launches-diplomat-inquiry-over-epstein-ties) over Epstein ties in February 2026.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
