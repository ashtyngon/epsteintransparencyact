**Hillary Clinton** accused the Trump administration of conducting a "cover-up" by slow-walking the release of Jeffrey Epstein files during a BBC interview published Tuesday. The former secretary of state's comments mark the highest-profile Democratic criticism yet of the Justice Department's handling of documents mandated under the Epstein Transparency Act.

"Get the files out. They are slow-walking it," Clinton told the BBC. The White House responded that it has done "more for the victims than Democrats ever did," according to the BBC report.

Clinton's accusation follows [recent analysis showing the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows), according to a study. The comment also comes after [Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed the DOJ released "all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed), a statement contradicted by multiple lawmakers and investigators.

## Congressional Access to Unredacted Files

Federal lawmakers in Minnesota and Iowa are now weighing whether to review unredacted Epstein files held in a Capitol Hill SCIF, according to KTTC Rochester. The secure facility contains versions of documents with fewer redactions than the public release provided by the Department of Justice.

Ro Khanna demanded the DOJ "stop protecting predators"](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) following his own review. [Rep. Nancy Mace accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) in the public version of the documents.

Massie specifically criticized Bondi's testimony during a February 13 hearing, stating she [avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) present in the room. He later said he had [lost confidence in the Attorney General](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over the files issue.

## What the Files Contain

The released documents contain thousands of pages of emails, flight logs, and financial records connecting Epstein to figures across business, politics, media, and academia. Search tools like [JeffTube have emerged](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse) to help the public navigate the complex document dump.

A search for "Staten Island" in the files yields hundreds of hits referencing underwear shipments, attorney correspondence, and autopsy details, according to SILive.com. The documents show transactions and communications tied to Epstein's New York operations during the years before his 2008 conviction and after his 2009 release from jail.

The files document Epstein's continued access to elite circles despite his status as a registered sex offender. [Documents show he was invited to Congressional galas years after his arrest](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-invited-to-congressional-galas-years-after-arrest-docs-show), according to records released by the DOJ.

## Trump's History With Epstein

Columnist commentary published in Vision Times argues Trump spent two decades exposing Epstein's crimes, though this characterization differs from documented timelines. Court records show Trump and Epstein socialized in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump told New York Magazine in 2002 that Epstein was "a terrific guy" who "likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."

Trump barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though accounts differ on when and why. Some reports place the ban in the mid-2000s following a dispute over real estate. Others tie it to allegations about Epstein's behavior toward a member's daughter.

In 2019, Trump told reporters he "had a falling out with him a long time ago." After Epstein's death in federal custody, [Trump called for an end to the Epstein investigation](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation), according to prior reporting.

[Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's Epstein ties have become a GOP liability](/news/2026-02-15-commerce-secretary-lutnick-s-epstein-ties-become-gop-liability), with multiple GOP senators viewing the contacts as politically damaging. [Trump insider Tom Barrack was also named in the files](/news/2026-02-14-trump-insider-tom-barrack-named-in-epstein-files).

## Partisan Divide Over Release

The dispute over file release has fractured along both partisan and institutional lines. Clinton's BBC comments represent the clearest Democratic attack on Trump administration handling of the documents since the Epstein Transparency Act became law.

[Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized Trump's Epstein file handling as a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation), showing fractures within the Republican coalition. [Congressional members accused Bondi of "mudding" the Epstein list by including dead celebrities](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) like Michael Jackson and Robin Williams alongside living individuals named in emails.

Bondi defended the release during multiple Congressional appearances. She [listed 300 names in the files](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release) but lawmakers note the list includes victims, lawyers, pilots, and household staff alongside potential co-conspirators. [Bondi maintained the DOJ released complete files](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more), a claim disputed by the 2% study and by lawmakers with SCIF access.
