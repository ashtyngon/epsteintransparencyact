**Hillary Clinton** accused the Trump administration of conducting a "cover-up" by slow-walking the release of Jeffrey Epstein files during a BBC interview published Tuesday. The former secretary of state's comments mark the highest-profile Democratic criticism yet of the Justice Department's handling of documents mandated under the Epstein Transparency Act.

"Get the files out. They are slow-walking it," Clinton told the BBC. The White House responded that it has done "more for the victims than Democrats ever did," according to the BBC report.

Clinton's accusation follows [recent analysis showing the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows), according to a study. The comment also comes after [Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed the DOJ released "all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed), a statement contradicted by multiple lawmakers and investigators.

## Congressional Access to Unredacted Files

Federal lawmakers in Minnesota and Iowa are now weighing whether to review unredacted Epstein files held in a Capitol Hill SCIF, according to KTTC Rochester. The secure facility contains versions of documents with fewer redactions than the public release provided by the Department of Justice.

[Rep. Thomas Massie declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) after reviewing files in the SCIF. Rep. Ro Khanna demanded the DOJ "stop protecting predators" following his own review. Rep. Nancy Mace accused the DOJ of hiding names in the public version of the documents.

Massie specifically criticized Bondi's testimony during a February 13 hearing, stating she avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors present in the room. He later said he had lost confidence in the Attorney General over the files issue.

## What the Files Contain

The released documents contain thousands of pages of emails, flight logs, and financial records connecting Epstein to figures across business, politics, media, and academia. Search tools like JeffTube have emerged to help the public navigate the complex document dump.

A search for "Staten Island" in the files yields hundreds of hits referencing underwear shipments, attorney correspondence, and autopsy details, according to SILive.com. The documents show transactions and communications tied to Epstein's New York operations during the years before his 2008 conviction and after his 2009 release from jail.

The files document Epstein's continued access to elite circles despite his status as a registered sex offender. Documents show he was invited to Congressional galas years after his arrest, according to records released by the DOJ.

## Trump's History With Epstein

Columnist commentary published in Vision Times argues Trump spent two decades exposing Epstein's crimes, though this characterization differs from documented timelines. Court records show Trump and Epstein socialized in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump told New York Magazine in 2002 that Epstein was "a terrific guy" who "likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."

Trump barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though accounts differ on when and why. Some reports place the ban in the mid-2000s following a dispute over real estate. Others tie it to allegations about Epstein's behavior toward a member's daughter.

In 2019, Trump told reporters he "had a falling out with him a long time ago." After Epstein's death in federal custody, Trump called for an end to the Epstein investigation, according to prior reporting.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's Epstein ties have become a GOP liability, with multiple GOP senators viewing the contacts as politically damaging. Trump insider Tom Barrack was also named in the files.

## Partisan Divide Over Release

The dispute over file release has fractured along both partisan and institutional lines. Clinton's BBC comments represent the clearest Democratic attack on Trump administration handling of the documents since the Epstein Transparency Act became law.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized Trump's Epstein file handling as a "political miscalculation", showing fractures within the Republican coalition. Congressional members accused Bondi of "mudding" the Epstein list by including dead celebrities like Michael Jackson and Robin Williams alongside living individuals named in emails.

Bondi defended the release during multiple Congressional appearances. She listed 300 names in the files but lawmakers note the list includes victims, lawyers, pilots, and household staff alongside potential co-conspirators. Bondi maintained the DOJ released complete files, a claim disputed by the 2% study and by lawmakers with SCIF access.

## International Investigations Expand

The files release triggered global consequences beyond U.S. partisan disputes. France established a special team to review files for French nationals. French prosecutors opened an investigation into a diplomat named in the documents.

The UK launched a national task force for Epstein trafficking allegations. UK prosecutors stated "nobody is above the law" as police investigate Prince Andrew. New emails contradicted Prince Andrew's BBC interview claims. Documents show Andrew's aide advised Epstein to hide his conviction on visa forms.

UN experts called for investigation into the files and warned of potential crimes against humanity, according to a UN statement.

## Resignations and Institutional Fallout

The files triggered waves of resignations across sectors. Dubai ports chief resigned after hundreds of secret emails surfaced. Goldman Sachs top lawyer resigned after being named. Casey Wasserman sold his agency and stepped down from Olympic roles after Maxwell emails emerged.

Hyatt heir Tom Pritzker stepped down over contact links. Sarah Ferguson shut down six companies after ties were exposed. Columbia University removed staff who facilitated an Epstein-linked dental school admission.

Congress subpoenaed Peter Mandelson and Les Wexner to testify. A court allowed a Bank of America trafficking lawsuit to proceed.

## Educational Institutions Under Scrutiny

Multiple educational institutions face questions about Epstein connections. DOJ files show Epstein pulled strings at the University of Alabama. College presidents and professors were named across multiple institutions.

Craven County Schools in North Carolina responded to student records found in the files. NYC Schools Chancellor Joel Klein met with Epstein in 2013, years after his conviction.

Files show Epstein used Nobel Prize access to lure his elite network. Nobel Committee chief Thorbjorn Jagland received gifts from Epstein, according to emails.

## Media Figures and Business Leaders

Media mogul Michael Ferro canceled a last-minute meeting with Epstein, emails show. Piers Morgan appeared 29 times in the files, primarily in email headers and forwarded messages.

Naomi Campbell's ties were exposed in multiple file releases. Orioles owner David Rubenstein was named. Indian businessman, minister, and guru were named.

Leon Black's naming led schools to cancel photo day. Black previously acknowledged paying Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning advice between 2012 and 2017, years after Epstein's conviction.

## Political Connections and Campaign Finance

Documents detail political access Epstein maintained despite his criminal record. Consultants pitched Epstein access to New York Democrats for donations, according to emails.

A senator blocked Epstein files after receiving a mysterious donation. Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner, Epstein's longtime business partner and mentor.

A MAGA candidate's family bought Epstein's Zorro Ranch for $13.4 million. The candidate, Don Huffines, is running for Texas Comptroller. Texas GOP expressed alarm over the purchase.

## Victims and Survivor Testimony

Epstein survivor Juliette Bryant told reporters she "thought I was going to die" during her abuse. Bryant attended Congressional hearings where she confronted officials about the limited file release.

Ghislaine Maxwell offered to reveal the "truth" in exchange for clemency, according to statements from her representatives. Maxwell is currently serving 20 years in federal prison for sex trafficking.

One expert warned that raw file release could harm ongoing investigations, creating tension between transparency demands and prosecutorial concerns.

## Unusual Document Contents

Some released materials include unexpected elements. Newly released video from Epstein's office appeared in the latest files dump. Steve Bannon discussed "taking down" Pope Francis with Epstein, according to DOJ files.

Emails show Epstein sympathized with Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. An ex-Clifford Chance lawyer's hidden ties were exposed in the email trove.

The FBI holds thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's secret island operation, separate from but related to the Epstein investigation.

## Public Commentary and Analysis

Joe Rogan stated the Epstein files "scare the hell out of me" during his podcast. Comedian Tim Dillon blasted Bondi's hearing testimony as "completely unprepared".

The New York Times launched a major investigation into millions of Epstein files. An NYT investigation revealed how elite immunity protected Epstein.
