A close associate of Prince Andrew advised Jeffrey Epstein to illegally conceal his child sexual abuse conviction when applying for a Chinese visa, according to documents released this week. **David Stern**, who maintained relationships with both the disgraced financier and the royal, provided guidance after Epstein's initial visa application was rejected by Chinese authorities.

The correspondence shows Stern advised against mentioning "being denied previously or criminal charges" on Epstein's visa application form, according to The Guardian. The guidance came after Epstein had already been convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida.

Deliberately omitting a criminal conviction on a visa application constitutes fraud under both U.S. and international law. The files do not indicate whether Epstein followed Stern's advice or whether he ultimately obtained the Chinese visa.

## Royal Circle Deepens Involvement

Stern's role extends the documented connections between Epstein and Prince Andrew's inner circle. The prince previously claimed in his 2019 BBC interview that his relationship with Epstein was limited and primarily conducted through mutual friends. 

[New emails surfaced earlier this week](/articles/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface) directly contradict several statements Andrew made during that interview. The correspondence shows more frequent contact than the prince acknowledged and reveals coordination on travel and meetings.

Stern's position as an intermediary between the royal and Epstein places him among several advisers and associates who facilitated access between elite circles and the convicted sex offender. The files document similar patterns of assistance from individuals across multiple sectors.

## Wexner Money Flows to Ohio Politicians

Ohio state politicians received campaign contributions from **Les Wexner**, the billionaire retail magnate identified in court documents as a key Epstein associate, according to WFMJ reporting. The station documented political donations from Wexner to multiple Ohio officeholders.

Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred ownership of his New York mansion to the financier for $1. Court documents filed by victims' attorneys describe Wexner as an alleged co-conspirator in Epstein's trafficking operation.

[Congress subpoenaed Wexner earlier this week](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), requiring him to testify about his financial relationship with Epstein and what he knew about the financier's activities. The subpoena represents the first time Wexner will face Congressional questioning under oath about his decades-long association with Epstein.

The Ohio politicians who received Wexner's contributions have not commented on whether they will return the funds or donate them to victim support organizations. WFMJ's review of campaign finance records shows donations spanning multiple election cycles.

## Elite Law Firm Faces Questions

The timing of leadership decisions at **Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison** attracted scrutiny as the Epstein files release approached. **Brad Karp**, the firm's chairman, faces questions about his continued position despite the firm's connections appearing in the documents.

Above the Law reported on internal discussions about whether Karp's tenure would continue as the file release loomed. Paul, Weiss has represented multiple high-profile clients with Epstein connections, and Karp's name appears in released correspondence.

The firm previously represented **Goldman Sachs** in various matters. [Goldman's top lawyer resigned this week](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the files. The resignation marked the first C-suite departure at a major investment bank directly linked to the document release.

[Multiple corporate executives and board members have resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties) since the files became public. The pattern spans industries from shipping to entertainment to finance.

## School Photo Company Responds to Concerns

**Lifetouch**, the national school photography company, issued a statement this week addressing concerns after connections to Epstein associates appeared in the files. The Austin American-Statesman reported that parents raised questions about data sharing practices.

The company stated in a press release that student photographs are not shared with outside parties. Lifetouch emphasized its privacy policies and data protection measures.

The concern emerged from documents showing Epstein's network maintained extensive databases of contact information and photographs of individuals across various institutions. [Earlier releases showed Epstein had influence at multiple educational institutions](/articles/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama), including the University of Alabama, where he directed donations and personnel decisions.

[College presidents and professors named in the files](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) face questions about what they knew regarding Epstein's activities and funding sources. Several institutions launched internal reviews of their vetting processes for major donors.

## Pattern of Facilitators

The Stern visa guidance adds to documented instances of individuals assisting Epstein in navigating legal and bureaucratic obstacles. The pattern appears across multiple jurisdictions and time periods.

[A former Clifford Chance lawyer's ties emerged](/articles/2026-02-14-epstein-emails-expose-ex-clifford-chance-lawyer-s-hidden-ties) in emails showing legal advice and introductions. [Consultants pitched Epstein's access to New York Democrats](/articles/2026-02-14-consultants-pitched-epstein-access-to-ny-democrats-for-donations) in exchange for campaign contributions. [A Nobel Committee chief received gifts](/articles/2026-02-13-nobel-chief-jagland-got-gifts-from-epstein-emails-reveal) according to correspondence.

The files document what victims' attorneys describe as a sophisticated operation requiring cooperation from advisers in law, finance, politics, and social circles. Each facilitator's role appears limited in isolation, but the aggregate picture shows coordinated assistance.

Defense attorneys for individuals named in the files argue that appearing in Epstein's correspondence does not establish knowledge of criminal activity. They note that many people conducted legitimate business with Epstein before his 2008 conviction and that social connections alone do not demonstrate culpability.

## Congressional Investigation Expands

The House Oversight Committee expanded its investigation this week, issuing additional subpoenas beyond those for [Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and [Peter Mandelson](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe). Committee Chairman **Ro Khanna** stated the panel will examine both Epstein's activities and the institutional failures that enabled them.

[Khanna previously demanded the release of names](/articles/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down) that remain redacted despite the Transparency Act. [One lawmaker named six men still hidden](/articles/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) in the files despite statutory requirements for disclosure.

The Justice Department defended its redaction decisions, with [Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) that ongoing investigations and privacy concerns justify withholding certain names. [The FBI provided its explanation](/articles/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) in a letter to Congress, citing specific legal exemptions.

[Critics accused the Trump DOJ of a cover-up](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) over the extent of redactions. [President Trump himself called for ending the investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation), stating in a social media post that the matter had been "investigated enough."

The tension between Congressional transparency demands and executive branch redaction decisions represents the central conflict in the ongoing document release. [The Transparency Act signed into law](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) requires disclosure but includes exemptions for ongoing investigations and national security.

## Legal Actions Advance

[A federal court allowed a lawsuit against Bank of America to proceed](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed), rejecting the bank's motion to dismiss trafficking-related claims. Plaintiffs allege the bank facilitated Epstein's operation by processing suspicious transactions without proper reporting.

The ruling marks a significant development in civil litigation, establishing that financial institutions can face liability for enabling trafficking operations through their services. Bank of America stated it will vigorously defend against the claims.

[The New York Times launched a major investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into the millions of pages of documents now available. The newspaper assembled a team to analyze correspondence, financial records, and calendar entries spanning decades.

[An earlier Times investigation detailed how elite immunity protected Epstein](/articles/2026-02-13-how-elite-immunity-protected-epstein-nyt-investigation-reveals), examining the institutional failures across law enforcement, prosecution, and the judicial system that allowed his activities to continue.

## Public Reaction Intensifies

[Podcast host Joe Rogan said the files "scare the hell out of me"](/articles/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-epstein-files-scare-the-hell-out-of-me) during his broadcast this week, reflecting broader public reaction to the scope of connections revealed. [Newly released video from Epstein's office](/articles/2026-02-13-newly-released-video-from-epstein-s-office-revealed-in-latest-files-dump) showed interactions with visitors whose identities remain under analysis.

[Media mogul Michael Ferro canceled a last-minute meeting with Epstein](/articles/2026-02-13-media-mogul-michael-ferro-canceled-last-minute-epstein-meeting-emails-reveal), according to correspondence. [Piers Morgan appeared 29 times in the files](/articles/2026-02-13-piers-morgan-named-29-times-in-epstein-files-here-s-what-we-found), primarily in connection with social events and potential media projects.

[One senator blocked files after receiving a mysterious donation](/articles/2026-02-13-senator-blocked-epstein-files-after-receiving-mysterious-donation), according to campaign finance records reviewed alongside the document timeline. [Bondi faced accusations of spying on Democrats' Epstein file searches](/articles/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches).

[Analysis published earlier this week examined how the case exposes systemic failures](/articles/2026-02-14-epstein-case-exposes-cracks-in-america-s-rule-of-law-system) in American legal institutions. The evaluation focused on prosecutorial decisions, plea agreement terms, and supervision lapses.

The Congressional hearings continue next week with testimony from subpoenaed witnesses. Additional document releases are scheduled under the Transparency Act's rolling disclosure requirements. Multiple federal and state investigations remain active despite the President's stated position that the matter should be closed.
