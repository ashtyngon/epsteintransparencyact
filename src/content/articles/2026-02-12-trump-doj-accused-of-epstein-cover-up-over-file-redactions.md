A Newsmax host tore into the Trump administration Wednesday, accusing the Justice Department of orchestrating a cover-up by redacting names from Epstein files and demanding that officials "go to jail."

Carl Higbie, who hosts "Carl Higbie Frontline," used his broadcast to blast the DOJ for blacking out identifying information throughout documents connected to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex trafficker whose network has become a litmus test for government transparency.

"I want somebody to go to jail," Higbie said, according to The Hill.

## Conservative Outlet Breaks With Trump

The attack is striking coming from Newsmax, which typically provides friendly coverage of the administration. Higbie didn't hedge — he accused Trump's DOJ of running a "cover-up" by shielding names that should be public.

The criticism arrives as the administration faces pressure from multiple directions on Epstein documents. [Attorney General Pam Bondi dodged questions Tuesday](/articles/2026-02-13-ag-questioned-on-epstein-files-release) about when files would be released and what would remain hidden. Days earlier, [Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation entirely](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) — a position that transparency advocates say amounts to shutting down accountability before it begins.

## Transparency Law, Redacted Results

The irony is hard to miss. Trump signed the Epstein Transparency Act into law, mandating declassification of records related to the financier's crimes and connections. But the documents trickling out have arrived heavily redacted, obscuring exactly what the law was meant to expose.

Higbie's demand for criminal prosecution takes the controversy beyond policy criticism into direct accountability. He's not asking for better processes or more transparency — he wants Justice Department officials prosecuted for limiting what Americans can see.

Names have continued surfacing despite the redactions. [A congressman recently revealed six individuals in the files and labeled billionaire Les Wexner a co-conspirator](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-reveals-6-named-in-epstein-files-labels-wexner-co-conspirator). [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned after his communications with Epstein became public](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-epstein-links).

But the question Higbie raises cuts deeper: Why redact at all if the point of the law was disclosure? And who decided which names the public gets to see and which remain protected?

The administration now faces criticism from its own allies over whether it will enforce the transparency law it championed — or whether the redactions reveal that some names were never meant to come out.
