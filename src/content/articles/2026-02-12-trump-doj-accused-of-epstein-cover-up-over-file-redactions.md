A Newsmax host criticized the Trump administration Wednesday, accusing the Justice Department of orchestrating a cover-up by redacting names from Epstein files and demanding that officials "go to jail."

Carl Higbie, who hosts "Carl Higbie Frontline," used his broadcast to blast the DOJ for blacking out identifying information throughout documents connected to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex trafficker whose network has become a litmus test for government transparency.

"I want somebody to go to jail," Higbie said, according to The Hill.

## Conservative Outlet Breaks With Trump

The criticism is notable coming from Newsmax, which typically provides supportive coverage of the administration. Higbie accused Trump's DOJ of running a "cover-up" by shielding names that should be public.

The criticism arrives as the administration faces pressure from multiple directions on Epstein documents. [Attorney General Pam Bondi faced questioning Tuesday](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) about when files would be released and what would remain hidden. Days earlier, [Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation entirely](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation). Transparency advocates criticized that position.

## Transparency Law, Redacted Results

Trump signed the Epstein Transparency Act into law on November 19, 2025, after it passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously, mandating declassification of records related to the financier's crimes and connections. The DOJ subsequently released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos — but the documents arrived heavily redacted, obscuring information the law was designed to make public.

Higbie's demand for criminal prosecution takes the controversy beyond policy criticism into direct accountability. He's not asking for better processes or more transparency — he wants Justice Department officials prosecuted for limiting what Americans can see.

Names have continued surfacing despite the redactions. [A congressman recently revealed six individuals in the files and labeled billionaire Les Wexner — who transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion to Epstein for $0 — a co-conspirator](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act). [Kathryn Ruemmler, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned after emails surfaced showing she referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey"](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files).

Higbie's central criticism is that the law mandated disclosure, and the DOJ's redactions contradict that mandate. He asked who decided which names the public can see and which remain protected.

The administration now faces criticism from its own allies over whether it will fully enforce the transparency law it championed.
