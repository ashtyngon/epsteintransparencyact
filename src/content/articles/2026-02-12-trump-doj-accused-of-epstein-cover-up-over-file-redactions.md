Newsmax host Carl Higbie criticized the Trump administration Wednesday, accusing the Justice Department of a cover-up by redacting names from Epstein files and demanding that officials "go to jail," according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Higbie, who hosts "Carl Higbie Frontline," criticized the DOJ on his broadcast for redacting identifying information throughout documents connected to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex trafficker.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"I want somebody to go to jail," Higbie said, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Conservative Outlet Criticizes Trump

The criticism is notable coming from Newsmax, which typically provides supportive coverage of the administration. Higbie accused Trump's DOJ of a "cover-up" by withholding names that, according to him, should be public.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The criticism arrives as the administration faces pressure from multiple directions on Epstein documents. [Attorney General Pam Bondi faced questioning Tuesday](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) about when files would be released and what would remain hidden.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Days earlier, [Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation entirely](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation).<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Transparency Law, Redacted Results

Trump signed the Epstein Transparency Act into law on November 19, 2025, after it passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously, mandating declassification of records related to the financier's activities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The DOJ subsequently released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos — but the documents arrived heavily redacted.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Higbie called for criminal prosecution of DOJ officials he says are limiting public access to the files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Names have continued surfacing despite the redactions. [A congressman named six individuals in the files on the House floor, including billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) — who transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion to Epstein for $0, according to property records.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Kathryn Ruemmler, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned after emails surfaced in which she referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey."<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Higbie stated that the law mandated disclosure and that the DOJ's redactions contradict that mandate. He asked who decided which names the public can see and which remain withheld.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The administration now faces criticism from within its own political coalition over whether it will fully comply with the transparency law.
