The New York Times reported that elite physicians provided medical care to both Jeffrey Epstein and young women he referred to as his "girls," creating dual professional relationships that raise questions about medical ethics and conflicts of interest.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Times investigation found that doctors who served as Epstein's personal physicians also treated young women in his orbit.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> These overlapping patient relationships placed medical professionals in positions where they provided care to both a wealthy benefactor and vulnerable individuals connected to him.

## Medical Ethics and Conflicts of Interest

Standard medical ethics guidelines require physicians to avoid conflicts of interest that could compromise their professional judgment or patients' welfare. The American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics states that physicians must recognize conflicts of interest that arise in patient care and take steps to prevent those conflicts from undermining professional judgment.

When a doctor treats both a wealthy patron and individuals that patron brings to them for care, ethical questions arise about whether the physician can maintain independent judgment, particularly if signs of abuse or coercion are present. The financial and social relationship with one patient—especially a prominent benefactor—can create pressure that affects how a physician treats other patients referred by that individual.

The Times reporting documents how Epstein cultivated relationships with prominent professionals across multiple fields, including medicine.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> These connections formed part of the broader network that enabled his operations over decades.

## Epstein's Professional Network

Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida. Despite this conviction, he maintained relationships with elite figures in finance, academia, science, law, and medicine. He died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal sex trafficking charges. The trial revealed details about how Epstein recruited and abused young women and girls over decades, with Maxwell playing a central role in the operation.

Following these prosecutions, investigators and journalists have continued examining the systems that enabled Epstein's crimes. The role of professional enablers—including lawyers, accountants, pilots, and now physicians—has become a focus of ongoing scrutiny.

## Document Release Efforts

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into federal law earlier this year, mandates the release of government documents related to Epstein's case. The law requires federal agencies to review and declassify records, with limited exceptions for ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.

Under the Act, the FBI has [begun reviewing Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) held across multiple federal agencies. The law represents Congress's effort to ensure public accountability and transparency regarding how Epstein maintained his operations despite prior criminal conviction.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) stated that documents she has reviewed show Epstein's network was ["much bigger" than previously understood](/news/2026-02-24-rep-mace-epstein-files-reveal-much-bigger-criminal-network). Congressional investigators have subpoenaed multiple individuals with ties to Epstein as part of ongoing oversight.

The Times investigation into Epstein's medical connections represents continued efforts to document the full scope of his operations and identify professionals who may have facilitated or witnessed his crimes. As document releases continue under the Transparency Act, additional details about these professional relationships may emerge.
