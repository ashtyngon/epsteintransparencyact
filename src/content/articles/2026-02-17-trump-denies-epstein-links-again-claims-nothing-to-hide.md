President **Donald Trump** denied connections to Jeffrey Epstein beyond a "fallout" years ago and told reporters he has "nothing to hide" regarding government files on the deceased financier's network, according to Open Magazine. <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The 2002 Characterization

In a **2002** New York Magazine profile, Trump called Epstein "a terrific guy" and said he had "known Jeff for fifteen years." <sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

"He's a lot of fun to be with," Trump said. "It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." <sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Epstein was convicted of soliciting a minor in 2008. He died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. <sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Document Release Under Fire

Trump's comments followed criticism of Attorney General **Pam Bondi's** handling of Epstein files. An independent analysis found the DOJ [released only 2% of Epstein-related files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows) in its recent document release, according to document transparency researchers. <sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Bondi stated the department released "all" materials required under the Epstein Transparency Act. <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Rep. **Thomas Massie**, a Kentucky Republican, [said he lost confidence in Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) after a congressional hearing where he said she avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors. <sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Rep. **Nancy Mace** of South Carolina accused the DOJ of "hiding names" through redactions. <sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Rep. **Ro Khanna**, a California Democrat, told the DOJ to "stop protecting predators" and release unredacted files. <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## GOP Split

Rep. **Marjorie Taylor Greene**, typically a Trump ally, called the handling of files a "political miscalculation" and said she received death threats after publicly criticizing the redactions. <sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

Commerce Secretary **Howard Lutnick's** documented Epstein contacts have drawn scrutiny from GOP senators, according to Open Magazine. <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## International Probes

Law enforcement agencies in multiple countries opened investigations based on the released files. The United Kingdom launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations. France established a special review team for French nationals named in files. New Mexico opened its first investigation into Epstein's Zorro Ranch property. <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

UN experts called for investigation into potential crimes against humanity based on the scope of allegations in released documents. <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
