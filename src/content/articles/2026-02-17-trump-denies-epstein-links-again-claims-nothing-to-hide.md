President Donald Trump denied connections to Jeffrey Epstein beyond a "fallout" years ago and told reporters he has "nothing to hide" regarding government files on the deceased financier's network, according to Open Magazine.

The statement comes as Trump's Justice Department faces mounting pressure over the scope of recently released Epstein documents.

## The 2002 Characterization

Trump's current characterization of limited contact with Epstein differs from his 2002 description of the relationship. In a New York Magazine profile that year, Trump called Epstein "a terrific guy" and said he had "known Jeff for fifteen years."

"He's a lot of fun to be with," Trump said. "It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."

Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. He died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

## Document Release Under Fire

Trump's comments follow sustained criticism of Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of Epstein files. An independent analysis found the DOJ [released only 2% of Epstein-related files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows) in its recent document dump, despite Bondi's claims the department released "all" materials.

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, [said he lost confidence in Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) after a congressional hearing where he said she [avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing). Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina [accused the DOJ of "hiding names"](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) through redactions that obscure alleged perpetrators while removing victim identities.

Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, told the DOJ to ["stop protecting predators"](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) and release unredacted files.

## GOP Split

The files controversy has created fractures within Trump's party. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, typically a Trump ally, [called the handling of files a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) and said she [received death threats](/news/2026-02-17-greene-faces-death-threats-over-trump-epstein-files-dispute) after publicly criticizing the redactions.

[Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's documented Epstein contacts](/news/2026-02-15-commerce-secretary-lutnick-s-epstein-ties-become-gop-liability) have become what GOP senators view as a political liability for the administration.

## International Probes Expand

While Trump maintains he has "nothing to hide," law enforcement agencies in multiple countries have opened investigations based on the limited files released.

The United Kingdom [launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations. France [established a special review team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) for French nationals named in files. New Mexico [opened its first full investigation](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) into Epstein's Zorro Ranch property.

UN experts [called for investigation](/news/2026-02-16-un-experts-call-for-investigation-into-epstein-files-warn-of-crimes-against-huma) into potential crimes against humanity based on the scope of allegations in released documents.

Trump [called for an end to Epstein investigations](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) shortly after taking office in 2025. His statement that he has "nothing to hide" comes as the Justice Department under his authority continues to withhold the majority of investigative files from public release.
