A former FBI agent told Fox Business that an armed man who attempted to gain entry to Mar-a-Lago had an "obsession" with Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The incident involved an unidentified individual who tried to enter the Palm Beach resort, though specific details about when the attempted entry occurred were not disclosed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The former FBI agent, whose name was not provided, characterized the suspect's focus on Epstein as an obsession.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Fox Business did not specify whether the individual was arrested, what charges may have been filed, or what specific connection the person claimed to the Epstein case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> No details were provided about what type of weapon the individual was carrying or how far the person progressed before being stopped.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Mar-a-Lago has been former President Donald Trump's primary residence since he left office in January 2021.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The property functions both as a private club and as Trump's home, with Secret Service protection maintained at the location.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

In February 2026, an [armed man was shot dead at Mar-a-Lago](/news/2026-02-23-armed-man-shot-dead-at-mar-a-lago-under-investigation-for-epstein-files-link) in a separate incident that authorities later said was under investigation for potential Epstein files connections. It remains unclear whether the incident described by Fox Business is related to that event or represents a different security breach.

## Trump and Epstein Connections

Trump's name appeared in documents released as part of civil litigation related to Epstein. Trump flew on Epstein's aircraft on at least one occasion in 1997, according to flight logs that became public. Trump told New York Magazine in 2002 that he had known Epstein for 15 years and called him a "terrific guy." Trump later stated in 2019 that he had a falling out with Epstein and "was not a fan."

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had previously been convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida under a controversial plea agreement.

Congress passed the Epstein Transparency Act in December 2024, which Trump signed into law in January 2025. The legislation mandates the release of federal records related to Epstein's case. The [Justice Department's handling of the file release](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows) has drawn criticism from members of Congress who say the disclosures remain incomplete.
