The House Judiciary Committee questioned Attorney General Pam Bondi this week as the roster of Jeffrey Epstein associates continues expanding—and as frustration grows over the Justice Department's handling of document releases.

Details of the exchange remain undisclosed, but the hearing comes at a moment when the gap between the Epstein Transparency Act's promises and the DOJ's actual disclosures has become impossible to ignore.

## A Pattern of Selective Release

The DOJ's approach to transparency has been contradictory at best. [Documents obtained by this site](/articles/2026-02-13-doj-tracking-lawmaker-epstein-file-searches-bondi-document-reveals) revealed the department is tracking which members of Congress search for specific names in the Epstein files—raising obvious questions about whether political calculations are driving disclosure decisions.

Meanwhile, the [Trump administration has been accused of orchestrating a cover-up](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) through heavy redactions, even as President Trump himself [publicly called for ending the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) entirely. The [FBI only recently began its mandated review](/articles/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the transparency law, months after it should have started.

Last week, a congressman took matters into his own hands, [naming six men from the House floor](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-on-house-floor) whose identities were shielded by redactions. He [specifically labeled billionaire Les Wexner a co-conspirator](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-reveals-6-named-in-epstein-files-labels-wexner-co-conspirator) in Epstein's trafficking operation—a designation the DOJ has declined to make public.

## New Names, Old Questions

Despite years of official secrecy, Epstein connections keep surfacing. Goldman Sachs [lost its top lawyer](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after emails showed her calling Epstein "uncle Jeffrey." A Dubai port executive [was forced out](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails) over Epstein emails. [Prince Andrew's BBC denials](/articles/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface) crumbled under newly released correspondence.

A federal judge [allowed a trafficking lawsuit against Bank of America to proceed](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed), with allegations the bank knowingly facilitated Epstein's operation. The New York Times [launched a major investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into millions of pages of documents.

## Congress Forces the Issue

Lawmakers are bypassing the DOJ's slow-walk strategy. Congress has already [subpoenaed Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about his decades-long financial entanglement with Epstein. The Judiciary Committee's questioning of Bondi signals that oversight will only intensify.

The core problem is simple: a transparency law exists, but the department enforcing it has shown little interest in actual transparency. Every new document release reveals connections that were hidden. Every delay raises questions about who's being protected.

Bondi's appearance before the committee won't be her last. With each batch of documents exposing previously concealed ties to Epstein, the pressure on DOJ to explain its redaction decisions—and its glacial pace—will only grow.
