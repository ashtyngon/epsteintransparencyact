Former senior civil servants have reported that **Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor** charged British taxpayers for massage expenses and excessive travel costs during his tenure as the UK's trade envoy, according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The former senior civil servants told The Guardian they were shocked upon seeing the expense claims submitted by Mountbatten-Windsor.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The officials described a culture of deference within **Whitehall** toward the former prince that allowed questionable expenses to be approved without proper scrutiny.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Expense Claims and Approval Process

The Guardian's reporting indicates that massage costs were among the expenses charged to taxpayers during Mountbatten-Windsor's time serving as trade envoy for the United Kingdom.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Former civil servants characterized the travel expenses as excessive.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

According to the former officials who spoke to The Guardian, the deferential treatment Mountbatten-Windsor received within government bureaucracy meant that expense claims that would have faced scrutiny if submitted by other officials were "waved through" without challenge.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The civil servants' accounts to The Guardian suggest that standard approval processes applied to other government officials' expenses were not applied equally to Mountbatten-Windsor's claims.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The culture of deference described by the former officials indicates that his status as a member of the royal family influenced how his expense submissions were reviewed within British government departments.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Details Not Disclosed

The Guardian's report does not specify the total amount of taxpayer money involved in the massage and travel expenses.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The report also does not identify the specific civil servants who raised concerns about the claims or provide the time period during which the expenses were charged.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The nature of the massage expenses—whether they were charged during official travel, the frequency of such claims, or the justification provided for them—was not detailed in The Guardian's reporting.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Similarly, what made the travel expenses "excessive" in the view of the former civil servants was not elaborated upon in the report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Mountbatten-Windsor served as the UK's trade envoy, a position that involved promoting British business interests abroad and facilitating trade relationships.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> [UK authorities have recently expanded their investigation into Mountbatten-Windsor's conduct](/news/2026-02-22-uk-mp-seeks-treason-probe-into-prince-andrew-over-epstein), including scrutiny of his activities during his time in public-facing roles.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Guardian report indicates that multiple former senior civil servants were aware of the expense claims and the deferential treatment that allowed them to proceed through approval channels.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
