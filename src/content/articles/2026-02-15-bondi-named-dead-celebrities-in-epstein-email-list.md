Attorney General Pam Bondi released a Department of Justice list of names found in Epstein-related emails that included deceased celebrities -- individuals who had died years before the emails were sent, according to The Daily Beast.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Members of Congress criticized the list after multiple figures who could not have been alive when the communications occurred appeared among names presented as Epstein email contacts.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The DOJ provided no dates of death or explanatory context with the names.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Vetting Questions

The inclusion of deceased individuals prompted members of Congress to question what vetting occurred before publication.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The names were released under the Epstein Transparency Act, [signed into law in 2026](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which mandates disclosure of government records related to Jeffrey Epstein's activities and network.

The law includes provisions for redacting information that could compromise ongoing investigations or violate privacy rights of uninvolved persons. It does not address verification standards for names released.

## Third Disputed Disclosure

The list was Bondi's third Epstein file release in one week to draw criticism. The Attorney General faced [accusations over extensive redactions](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) in the initial document release, and was reported to have [monitored which Democratic lawmakers searched the files](/news/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

At a February 13 congressional hearing, Bondi defended the redaction policy but did not address document verification procedures.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Days before the deceased-names list surfaced, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the administration's Epstein file handling a "political miscalculation." President Trump has called for ending the Epstein investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Department of Justice has not announced plans to issue a corrected list or explained how deceased individuals appeared on a roster of email correspondents.
