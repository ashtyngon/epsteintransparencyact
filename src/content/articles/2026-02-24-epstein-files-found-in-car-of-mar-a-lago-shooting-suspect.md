## Second Security Incident Linked to Epstein Case

This marks the second known security incident at Mar-a-Lago involving an individual focused on the Epstein case. According to former FBI agent Kenneth Gray, [an earlier armed intruder had an obsession with the Epstein case](/news/2026-02-24-armed-mar-a-lago-intruder-had-epstein-obsession-ex-fbi-agent-says) and had searched online for information about Epstein's death before the intrusion.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The shooting took place at the entrance to Mar-a-Lago, where security protocols are in place for the property.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Mar-a-Lago has served as Trump's primary residence since he left office in January 2021 and operates as a private club with membership fees exceeding $200,000.

## Epstein Files and Ongoing Document Releases

The Epstein files have been the subject of intense public scrutiny since their release. The documents contain depositions, witness testimony, and other materials related to litigation involving the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida, receiving a controversial plea agreement that allowed him to serve 13 months in county jail with work release privileges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act, which mandates the declassification of government documents related to Epstein and his associates, was signed into federal law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The FBI has begun a review of Epstein-related records under the law, which requires federal agencies to release documents related to the financier's activities and connections.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Court-ordered document releases have continued since early 2024, when a federal judge unsealed hundreds of pages of depositions and exhibits from civil litigation involving Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The ongoing document releases have prompted congressional hearings, international investigations, and calls for additional transparency from lawmakers and advocacy groups.
