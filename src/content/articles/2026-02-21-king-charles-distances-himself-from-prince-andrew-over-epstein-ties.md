# Queen Elizabeth Defended Andrew Through Epstein Scandal; King Charles Withdraws Support After Arrest

**King Charles III** has withdrawn royal support from his brother **Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor** following Andrew's arrest on document-sharing charges related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, a stark departure from the protection their late mother **Queen Elizabeth II** provided during earlier stages of the scandal.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Andrew, who was stripped of his royal titles and now goes by his surname Mountbatten-Windsor, is receiving no assistance from the throne as the crisis over his ties to Epstein intensifies, according to the New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The shift marks a clear break from Elizabeth's approach, which included standing by Andrew through the civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre and the public fallout from his 2019 BBC interview.

The change in royal support comes as Andrew faces criminal charges in connection with the Epstein investigation, following his [arrest on February 19](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-on-document-sharing-charges-in-epstein-case).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Queen Elizabeth's Support Versus Charles's Distance

Queen Elizabeth II maintained support for Andrew during multiple stages of the Epstein scandal, including the period when allegations about his association with the convicted sex offender first emerged publicly and through his 2021 civil case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> That support continued until her death in September 2022.

King Charles, by contrast, has taken a different approach since ascending to the throne.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The withdrawal of support comes at what the Times describes as a critical juncture, with Andrew facing document-sharing charges that have expanded the scope of law enforcement scrutiny beyond his previous civil legal troubles.

The royal family's handling of Andrew has evolved through several phases, from his withdrawal from public duties in November 2019 following the BBC interview, to the January 2022 decision to strip him of military titles and royal patronages as the Giuffre lawsuit proceeded, to the current situation where he faces potential criminal liability.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Criticism of White House Messaging

**Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)** accused President Trump on February 20 of using discussion about UFOs and extraterrestrial life to divert attention from controversy surrounding files related to Epstein.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

"They've deployed the ultimate weapon of mass distraction, but the Epstein files aren't going away… even for aliens," Massie wrote on social media Thursday.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The Kentucky Republican has been among the most vocal members of Congress calling for release of documents related to the Epstein case.

Massie's statement drew criticism from some quarters, according to Fox News, with critics suggesting he should "seriously reconsider" his position in Congress over his demands related to Epstein files.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The backlash highlighted the continued political sensitivity surrounding congressional oversight of Epstein-related matters, even as multiple investigations proceed.

The congressman's comments came amid broader congressional activity following passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, which mandated [FBI review of Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) and set deadlines for declassification of certain documents.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Expanding Investigation Landscape

Andrew's legal situation has grown more complex in recent weeks, with Scotland Yard [expanding its probe to question protection officers](/news/2026-02-20-scotland-yard-expands-andrew-probe-questions-protection-officers-on-epstein-link) about his connections to Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The investigation includes examination of travel records and security arrangements during periods when Andrew allegedly met with Epstein.

The document-sharing charges that led to Andrew's arrest represent a new phase in legal scrutiny, distinct from the civil claims he settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> U.K. officials have also discussed the possibility of [removing Andrew from the line of royal succession](/news/2026-02-21-u-k-considers-removing-andrew-from-royal-succession-after-arrest), though no formal action has been taken.

Parallel investigations continue in multiple jurisdictions. New Mexico authorities [reopened examination of Epstein's Zorro Ranch](/news/2026-02-20-new-mexico-reopens-zorro-ranch-investigation-after-fbi-search-gap-revealed) after revelations about gaps in the original FBI search of the property, and the state attorney general [opened a criminal probe into bodies buried at the ranch site](/news/2026-02-19-new-mexico-ag-opens-criminal-probe-into-bodies-buried-at-epstein-ranch).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein estate reached a [$25 million settlement with abuse survivors](/news/2026-02-20-epstein-estate-settles-abuse-survivors-lawsuit-for-25m) in February 2026, resolving one of several civil claims against the late financier's assets.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Charles's decision to withdraw support for his brother comes as the monarchy faces broader questions about its handling of scandal and accountability, with the king's approach representing a notable shift from his mother's management of similar crises.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
