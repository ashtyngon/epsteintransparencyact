Six companies linked to Sarah Ferguson, ex-wife of Prince Andrew, are being dissolved after documents released last month showed she sent messages to Jeffrey Epstein following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Companies House, the UK's corporate registry, received applications to strike off each of the six Ferguson-linked companies after details of her contact with Epstein surfaced in the millions of pages released by U.S. authorities, according to public filings.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The applications were submitted last month, shortly after the document release showed the post-conviction messages between Ferguson and Epstein.

## Corporate Departures Follow Document Release

The Ferguson company closures are the latest in a series of corporate consequences following the document release. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> [Dubai Ports chief stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails were made public.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> [Casey Wasserman sold his talent agency](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) after documents showed his communications with Ghislaine Maxwell.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Hyatt heir Tom Pritzker also stepped down after contact with Epstein was documented in the files.

The pattern has differed across regions. European figures have faced investigations and resignations, while many American officials named in the documents have remained in their positions.

## Royal Family Under Scrutiny

Ferguson's former husband, Prince Andrew, has faced separate scrutiny over his Epstein connections. Released emails contradicted claims he made during his 2019 BBC interview, including denials about staying at Epstein's properties, according to reporting. Documents showed Prince Andrew's aide advised Epstein on concealing his criminal conviction on visa applications.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

UK police launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations connected to Epstein's network. The UK's top prosecutor stated "nobody is above the law" as authorities examine evidence involving Prince Andrew.

France established a special team to review the documents for French nationals, and prosecutors opened an investigation into at least one diplomat.

## Document Release and Transparency Debate

The Epstein files release has produced a dispute over redactions and completeness. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the DOJ released "all" files with full names listed. An independent analysis found the Trump DOJ released only 2% of available documents.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Rep. Ro Khanna called on authorities to release unredacted files. Rep. Nancy Mace demanded unredacted co-conspirator files. Rep. Thomas Massie declared "I am not suicidal" as pressure mounted for full disclosure.

UN experts called for investigation, stating the case could involve crimes against humanity.

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law earlier this year, mandated release of government records related to Epstein's case and associates. The document release followed FBI review of Epstein-related records under the new law.
