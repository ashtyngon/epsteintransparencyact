Six companies linked to Sarah Ferguson, ex-wife of Prince Andrew, are being dissolved after documents released last month revealed she sent messages to Jeffrey Epstein following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Companies House, the UK's corporate registry, received applications to strike off each of the six Ferguson-linked companies after details of her contact with the convicted sex offender surfaced in the millions of pages released by U.S. authorities, according to public filings.

The applications were submitted last month, shortly after the document release exposed the post-conviction messages between Ferguson and Epstein.

## Corporate Shutdowns Follow Document Release

The Ferguson company closures mark the latest in a series of corporate consequences triggered by the document release. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the files. [Dubai Ports chief stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails were made public. [Casey Wasserman sold his talent agency](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) after documents exposed his connections to Epstein's network.

Multiple corporate and political figures have faced consequences since the release, including Hyatt heir Tom Pritzker, who stepped down over contact links revealed in the files.

The pattern has differed across regions. European elites have faced investigations and resignations, while many American officials named in the documents have retained their positions.

## Royal Family Under Scrutiny

Ferguson's former husband, Prince Andrew, has faced separate scrutiny over his Epstein connections. Emails contradicted claims he made during his 2019 BBC interview, including denials about staying at Epstein's properties. Documents showed Prince Andrew's aide advised Epstein on concealing his criminal conviction on visa applications.

UK police launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations connected to Epstein's network. The UK's top prosecutor declared "nobody is above the law" as authorities examine Prince Andrew's role.

France established a special team to review the documents for French nationals, and prosecutors opened an investigation into at least one diplomat.

## Document Release Sparks Transparency Debate

The Epstein files release has sparked conflict over redactions and completeness. Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed the DOJ released "all" files with full names listed. Analysis showed the Trump DOJ released only 2% of available documents.

Rep. Ro Khanna called on authorities to "stop protecting predators." Rep. Nancy Mace demanded unredacted co-conspirator files. Rep. Thomas Massie declared "I am not suicidal" as pressure mounted for full disclosure.

UN experts called for investigation, warning the case could involve crimes against humanity.

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law earlier this year, mandated release of government records related to Epstein's crimes and associates. The document release followed FBI review of Epstein-related records under the new law.
