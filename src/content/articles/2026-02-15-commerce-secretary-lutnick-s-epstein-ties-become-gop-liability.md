Republican senators privately expressed concern that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's documented contacts with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein could become a political liability heading into the 2026 midterm elections, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Lutnick is considered on Capitol Hill to be one of President Trump's most influential economic advisers. The GOP concerns center on whether his documented Epstein connections could affect the party's electoral prospects.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Hill report did not detail the specific nature of Lutnick's contacts with Epstein or when they occurred. Republican senators interviewed for the story did not publicly specify what actions, if any, they might take regarding Lutnick's position.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Other Figures Named in Files

The concerns come amid professional consequences for other figures named in Epstein-related files. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned last week](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in documents.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> [Dubai's ports chief stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after emails with Epstein's network were made public.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Congress has issued subpoenas to [billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and UK diplomat Peter Mandelson as part of its investigation into Epstein's network of contacts.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The Commerce Secretary oversees trade policy, business regulation, and economic strategy. Lutnick's role gives him significant influence over Trump administration economic decisions.

President Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation, drawing criticism from members of his own party. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Trump's handling of the Epstein files a "political miscalculation."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The midterm elections are scheduled for November 2026.
