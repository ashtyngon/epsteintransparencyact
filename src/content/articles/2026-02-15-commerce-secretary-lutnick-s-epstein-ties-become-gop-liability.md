Republican senators have privately expressed concern that Commerce Secretary **Howard Lutnick**'s documented ties to convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein** could become a political liability heading into the November 2026 midterm elections, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The anxiety on Capitol Hill has deepened as Lutnick's own statements about his relationship with Epstein have shifted. Under questioning from Democrats, the Commerce Secretary acknowledged he met with Epstein twice after the financier's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor -- contradicting his earlier claim that he had severed contact after 2005.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## Island Visit and Business Ties

Lutnick confirmed that he and his family had lunch with Epstein on the financier's private Caribbean island in 2012, four years after the conviction. He characterized the stop as incidental to a family boat vacation, noting his wife, four children and nannies were present.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Records show the relationship extended beyond social visits. In 2012, Lutnick and Epstein signed an agreement to acquire stakes in a now-shuttered advertising technology company. As recently as 2014, Lutnick maintained a business partnership with Epstein, according to documents reviewed by CNN.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Lutnick is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, the financial services firm, and is regarded on Capitol Hill as one of President **Donald Trump**'s most influential economic advisers. As Commerce Secretary, he oversees trade policy, business regulation and economic strategy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Republican Senators Speak Out

Several senior Republicans have gone on the record with their concerns. Sen. **John Kennedy** (R-La.) said Lutnick needs to hold a press conference to address the revelations directly. Sen. **Roger Wicker** (R-Miss.) said the island visit "would raise questions." Sen. **Thom Tillis** (R-N.C.) told reporters the situation was "something I'm concerned with."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Senate Majority Leader **John Thune** said those mentioned in the Epstein files are "going to have to answer questions around that."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Republican senators have generally praised Lutnick's ability to negotiate trade deals that softened the economic impact of Trump's global tariffs. The Epstein revelations, however, have complicated their support.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Calls for Resignation

Rep. **Thomas Massie** (R-Ky.), a co-author of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that compelled the document release, called on Lutnick to resign.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, echoed the demand and called on Trump to fire Lutnick if he would not step down voluntarily.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

Garcia also said that House Oversight Chairman James Comer has not responded to his request to subpoena Lutnick for testimony, highlighting tensions between Democrats pressing for transparency and Republicans wary of jeopardizing other Epstein-related depositions.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>

## White House Stands By Lutnick

The White House has shown no indication that Trump is prepared to act on the resignation calls. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Lutnick remains an important member of the president's team and that Trump fully supports the secretary.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

Trump himself has called for ending the broader Epstein investigation, drawing criticism from within his own party. Rep. **Marjorie Taylor Greene** called Trump's handling of the Epstein files [a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation/).<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>
