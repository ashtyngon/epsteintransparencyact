Republican senators view Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a potential political liability heading into the 2026 midterm elections, according to The Hill.

Lutnick is viewed on Capitol Hill as one of President Trump's most influential economic advisers. The GOP concerns center on whether revelations about his Epstein connections could damage the party's electoral prospects.

The Hill report did not detail the specific nature of Lutnick's contacts with Epstein or when they occurred. Republican senators interviewed for the story did not publicly specify what actions, if any, they might take regarding Lutnick's position.

## Broader Pattern

The concerns emerge against a backdrop of mounting consequences for figures named in Epstein-related files. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned last week](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in documents. [Dubai Ports chief stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) following exposure of secret emails with Epstein's network.

Congress has issued subpoenas to [billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and UK diplomat Peter Mandelson as part of its investigation into Epstein's network of elite contacts.

The Commerce Secretary oversees trade policy, business regulation, and economic strategy. Lutnick's role gives him significant influence over Trump administration economic decisions.

President Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation, drawing criticism from members of his own party. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Trump's handling of the Epstein files a "political miscalculation".

The midterm elections are scheduled for November 2026.
