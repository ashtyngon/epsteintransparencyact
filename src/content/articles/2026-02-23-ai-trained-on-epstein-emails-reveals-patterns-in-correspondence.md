A company has released an AI chatbot trained on emails from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, according to Decrypt, raising questions about public access to materials related to the convicted sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The chatbot was trained on a trove of emails obtained from Epstein's business communications, Decrypt reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The publication tested the AI system and obtained responses based on the email dataset.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The technology firm that developed the system was not identified in the report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Decrypt tested the chatbot's responses but did not specify whether the tool is publicly accessible or limited to researchers and journalists.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Document Access and Transparency Efforts

The development comes as federal agencies continue processing records related to Epstein under the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed in January 2026.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> That legislation mandates intelligence and law enforcement agencies compile and review government documents concerning the financier and his associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The FBI has begun its review of Epstein-related documents following enactment of the transparency law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Congressional supporters of the legislation have stated that public disclosure of government records would help answer outstanding questions about how federal agencies handled investigations of Epstein over multiple decades.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Federal courts have also released batches of documents related to Epstein's activities, including materials from civil litigation involving Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former associate who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## AI Applications to Public Records

The use of artificial intelligence to analyze and interact with documents from high-profile cases represents a developing application of the technology to public records and investigative materials.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Questions about the authenticity, completeness, and provenance of email datasets used to train such systems remain relevant to their utility for investigative or research purposes.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He had previously been convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida, serving 13 months under a controversial plea agreement.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Multiple investigations into his activities spanned decades and involved numerous jurisdictions, resulting in extensive documentation across government agencies and court systems.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The FBI's ongoing review of Epstein-related records under the new transparency law is expected to provide additional documentation about the scope of investigations into Epstein and his network of associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
