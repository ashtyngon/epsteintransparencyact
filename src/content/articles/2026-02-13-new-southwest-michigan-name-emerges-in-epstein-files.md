# Southwest Michigan Resident Named in Epstein Documents, According to Local Radio Station

A resident from Southwest Michigan has been identified in recently released Epstein documents, according to **WGRD 97.9**, a local Grand Rapids radio station. The station reported on **February 13, 2026**, that "another familiar" name from the region appears in the files, though specific details about the individual's identity or their connection to the case were not provided in the available source material.

This marks at least the second instance of a Southwest Michigan connection to the Epstein files, based on the station's use of the word "another." The Epstein documents refer to the ongoing release of court records related to deceased financier **Jeffrey Epstein** and his associate **Ghislaine Maxwell**, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021.

## Limited Information Available

The WGRD 97.9 report does not specify which document release contains the Southwest Michigan name, nor does it clarify the nature of the individual's connection to Epstein. The source material does not indicate whether the person is named as a victim, witness, associate, or in another capacity.

The article title suggests the name is recognizable to local residents, but no identifying information is provided in the available content.

## Ongoing Document Releases

Federal courts have been releasing batches of previously sealed documents from a 2015 defamation lawsuit filed by Epstein accuser **Virginia Giuffre** against Ghislaine Maxwell. These releases have identified numerous individuals with various connections to Epstein, though appearance in the documents does not necessarily indicate wrongdoing.

Further details about the Southwest Michigan resident's identity and their specific connection to the Epstein case remain unclear based on the limited information available from this source.
