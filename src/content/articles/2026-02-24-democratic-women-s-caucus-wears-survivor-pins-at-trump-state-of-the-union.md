The State of the Union address represents one of the most widely televised events on the congressional calendar, typically drawing tens of millions of viewers. Members of Congress have historically used the occasion to make visual statements through their choice of guests, clothing, and accessories.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Focus on Epstein Case

The decision by Democratic women lawmakers comes amid ongoing congressional scrutiny of the Epstein case and related document releases. In December 2024, Congress passed the **Epstein Transparency Act**, which mandates the release of government records related to Epstein and his associates. The legislation passed the House by a vote of 382-26 and the Senate by unanimous consent before being signed into law by Trump in January 2025.

Multiple House members have made public statements about the case in recent weeks. **Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.)** [stated](/news/2026-02-24-rep-mace-epstein-files-reveal-much-bigger-criminal-network) that newly released Epstein files reveal a criminal network that is "much bigger" than previously understood. **Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.)** has [criticized the Department of Justice](/news/2026-02-24-rep-garcia-doj-withheld-fbi-interviews-with-trump-accuser-in-epstein-files) for allegedly withholding FBI interviews with a Trump accuser from the Epstein files released under the transparency law.

Other Democratic members have brought Epstein survivors as guests to the State of the Union address in a separate show of support for victims.

## Background on Epstein Case

**Jeffrey Epstein** was a financier who was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor. He was arrested again in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges but died in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner.

**Ghislaine Maxwell**, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and conspiracy. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Trump's history with Epstein has been documented in multiple news reports. In a 2002 interview with New York Magazine, Trump called Epstein "a terrific guy" and said he had known him for 15 years. Trump has since stated that he had a falling out with Epstein and was not close to him.

The State of the Union address has not yet been scheduled, but typically takes place in late February or early March. The address is delivered to a joint session of Congress and is attended by Supreme Court justices, cabinet members, and other senior government officials.

The visual protest planned by the Democratic Women's Caucus represents the latest congressional effort to keep attention focused on Epstein's victims and questions surrounding his criminal activities and associates.
