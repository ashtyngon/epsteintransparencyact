A letter published Monday in the Bangor Daily News calls for identification and punishment of individuals connected to Jeffrey Epstein.

The letter to the editor joins public demands for accountability as federal agencies process documents under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which mandated release of government records related to the case.

## Broader Pressure for Accountability

Law enforcement agencies in multiple countries have opened investigations since document releases began. The UK [established a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to examine trafficking allegations. French prosecutors [opened an investigation](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) into a diplomat named in files.

High-profile resignations have followed document releases. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in files. [Dubai's ports chief resigned](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails surfaced.

Congress issued subpoenas to [billionaire Leslie Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and [Peter Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) for testimony.

The FBI [began its review](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) of records following the law's passage, though lawmakers have criticized the Justice Department for maintaining redactions in released materials.
