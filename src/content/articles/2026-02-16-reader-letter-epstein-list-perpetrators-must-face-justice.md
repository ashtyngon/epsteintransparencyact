A letter to the editor published Monday in the Bangor Daily News called for identification and accountability for individuals named in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The letter joins public calls for accountability as federal agencies process documents under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which mandated release of government records related to the case.

## Investigations in Multiple Countries

Law enforcement agencies in multiple countries have opened investigations since document releases began. The UK [established a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to examine trafficking allegations.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> French prosecutors [opened an investigation](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) into a diplomat named in files.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Multiple resignations have followed document releases. Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down after being named in files.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Dubai's ports chief resigned after hundreds of emails surfaced.

Congress issued subpoenas to billionaire Leslie Wexner and Peter Mandelson for testimony.

The FBI began its review of records following the law's passage, though lawmakers have criticized the Justice Department for maintaining redactions in released materials.
