An ethics lawyer described the absence of criminal charges in the United States following the release of the Epstein files as "extraordinary," according to the **Australian Broadcasting Corporation**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The lawyer, who was not identified by name in the ABC report, made the assessment after reviewing the documents released under federal law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The statement comes after the release of documents under the **Epstein Transparency Act**, which was [signed into law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) and mandated the declassification of records related to **Jeffrey Epstein's** criminal activities and associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The law required federal agencies to review and release records connected to the convicted sex offender.

## Background on Epstein's Criminal Cases

Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor under a controversial plea agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution at the time. He was arrested again in July 2019 on federal charges of sex trafficking of minors, but died in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, approximately one month later. His death occurred while he was awaiting trial on the federal sex trafficking charges.

His associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.

## Congressional Assessment of Released Materials

Members of Congress have responded to the released documents with assessments of their significance. **Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.)** stated that the files reveal a ["much bigger" criminal network](/news/2026-02-24-rep-mace-epstein-files-reveal-much-bigger-criminal-network) than previously understood.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.)** said the [Department of Justice withheld FBI interviews](/news/2026-02-24-rep-garcia-doj-withheld-fbi-interviews-with-trump-accuser-in-epstein-files) with a Trump accuser from the released materials.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act mandated that federal agencies review and declassify materials unless specific national security exceptions applied. The [FBI began its review of Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the new law.

## Absence of New Prosecutions

Federal prosecutors have not announced any new indictments or charges stemming from the file releases.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The released materials reportedly contain names of individuals who had contact with Epstein and details about his activities over multiple decades.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The ethics lawyer quoted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation characterized this absence of prosecutorial action as "extraordinary" given the nature of the case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The ABC report adds to ongoing debate about whether the released files contain sufficient evidence to warrant new prosecutions, and whether law enforcement agencies have adequately pursued potential criminal cases arising from the documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Department of Justice has not issued a public statement explaining its prosecutorial decisions related to the Epstein files or addressing questions about why no additional charges have been filed following the document releases.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The [DOJ has faced accusations](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) from lawmakers over redactions in the released materials and questions about the completeness of the disclosure.
