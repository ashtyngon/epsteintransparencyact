Rep. Thomas Massie criticized President Trump's Justice Department over its handling of Epstein-related file releases, telling the Washington Examiner: "This is the Epstein administration."

"If you're not going to be transparent about this, you don't deserve to be called the transparency administration," Massie said.

The Kentucky Republican chairs the House subcommittee investigating Jeffrey Epstein's network. His comments target the DOJ's approach to documents mandated for release under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which Congress passed with bipartisan support.

## Redactions Controversy

The Trump DOJ has faced [accusations of covering up](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) information through excessive redactions in released files. The FBI has [defended its redactions](/articles/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) by citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.

Massie [previously named six men](/articles/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) whose identities remained redacted in official releases despite the transparency law. Last week, he [declared "I am not suicidal"](/articles/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over his investigation.

## Republican Split

Massie joins other Republicans who have broken with Trump over Epstein file handling. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene [called the administration's approach](/articles/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) a "political miscalculation." Trump has [called for ending the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) entirely.

Multiple Trump administration figures appear in released files, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose [Epstein ties have become a political liability](/articles/2026-02-15-commerce-secretary-lutnick-s-epstein-ties-become-gop-liability), and [Trump insider Tom Barrack](/articles/2026-02-14-trump-insider-tom-barrack-named-in-epstein-files).

Attorney General Pam Bondi has [resisted calls for complete unredacted releases](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release). Her office faced scrutiny after reports it [monitored Democrats' searches](/articles/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches) of the Epstein files database.

## International Response

[European officials have faced consequences](/articles/2026-02-14-epstein-files-topple-european-elites-while-u-s-officials-keep-power) for Epstein connections while U.S. figures have largely retained their positions. [France opened an investigation](/articles/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) into a diplomat named in the files. The [UK launched a national task force](/articles/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations.

The FBI [began its mandated review](/articles/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) of Epstein-related records following the law's passage. The agency has not provided a timeline for releasing additional unredacted documents.
