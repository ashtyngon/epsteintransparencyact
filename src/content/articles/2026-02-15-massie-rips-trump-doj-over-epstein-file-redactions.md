Rep. Thomas Massie criticized President Trump's Justice Department over its handling of Epstein-related file releases, telling the Washington Examiner: "This is the Epstein administration."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"If you're not going to be transparent about this, you don't deserve to be called the transparency administration," Massie said.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Kentucky Republican chairs the House subcommittee investigating Jeffrey Epstein's network. His comments target the DOJ's approach to documents mandated for release under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which Congress passed with bipartisan support.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Redactions Dispute

The Trump DOJ has faced [accusations over excessive redactions](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) in released files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The FBI has [defended its redactions](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) by citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Massie previously named six men whose identities remained redacted in official releases despite the transparency law.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Last week, he declared "I am not suicidal" as pressure mounted over his investigation.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## Republican Disagreements

Massie joins other Republicans who have criticized Trump over Epstein file handling. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called the administration's approach a "political miscalculation."<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Trump has called for ending the Epstein investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Multiple Trump administration figures appear in released files, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose documented Epstein contacts have drawn concern from Republican senators, and Trump associate Tom Barrack.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Attorney General Pam Bondi has declined calls for complete unredacted releases. Her office faced scrutiny after reports it monitored Democrats' searches of the Epstein files database.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

## International Response

France opened an investigation into a diplomat named in the files. The UK launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The FBI began its mandated review of Epstein-related records following the law's passage. The agency has not provided a timeline for releasing additional unredacted documents.
