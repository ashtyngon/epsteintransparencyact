Kathy Ruemmler, who served as White House counsel under President Obama, will resign from Goldman Sachs after emails revealed a close relationship between her and Jeffrey Epstein.

The resignation follows the emergence of email correspondence between Ruemmler and the convicted sex offender, according to NPR. Ruemmler later became Goldman Sachs' general counsel, one of the most senior legal positions on Wall Street.

## What the Emails Show

The emails demonstrated what NPR described as a "close relationship" between Ruemmler and Epstein. Goldman Sachs has not publicly addressed what the bank knew about these connections when it hired Ruemmler, or whether her communications with a convicted sex offender raised flags during any vetting process.

The departure adds another name to the growing list of elite figures whose Epstein ties have surfaced through document releases. Unlike many who've attempted to downplay their contact with Epstein as minimal or purely professional, the characterization of Ruemmler's relationship as "close" suggests more sustained interaction.

## A Pattern of Access

Ruemmler's case underscores how Epstein maintained relationships across the highest levels of government and finance. She held one of the most sensitive legal roles in the executive branch, advising the president on constitutional matters, before moving to lead legal affairs at one of Wall Street's most powerful banks.

That someone with her clearance and responsibility maintained a close relationship with a convicted sex offender raises questions about judgment at the top of American institutions. It also raises questions about Goldman Sachs — what due diligence did the bank conduct before placing her in charge of its legal department?

The bank hasn't answered.
