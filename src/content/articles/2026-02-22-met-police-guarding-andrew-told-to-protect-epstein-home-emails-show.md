Metropolitan Police officers assigned to protect Prince Andrew were directed to guard Jeffrey Epstein's London residence, according to emails disclosed by the force.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Metropolitan Police Service said it reviewed the communications and "has not identified any wrongdoing by its protection officers at this time."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The force did not specify when the assignments occurred, how many officers were involved, or who authorized the use of royal protection officers at a private residence.

## Limited Details Released

The Metropolitan Police statement provided no further details about the emails, including the time period covered or the circumstances that led to officers being deployed to Epstein's property.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

British taxpayers fund protection for senior members of the royal family through the Metropolitan Police's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command. The force has not clarified whether deploying officers to guard a non-royal residence fell within standard protocols or required special authorization.

The Metropolitan Police did not indicate whether additional review of the arrangements is planned or whether any policy changes will result.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Background on Epstein and Andrew

Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had been convicted in Florida in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor and was a registered sex offender.

Virginia Giuffre alleged in court filings that Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her to Andrew when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations. He settled Giuffre's civil lawsuit in February 2022 for an undisclosed sum without admitting liability.

Andrew was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages by Queen Elizabeth II in January 2022 and no longer performs public duties on behalf of the monarchy. Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence after being convicted in December 2021 of sex trafficking and conspiracy charges related to Epstein's abuse of teenage girls.

The Metropolitan Police have not announced whether the email review is connected to any active investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
