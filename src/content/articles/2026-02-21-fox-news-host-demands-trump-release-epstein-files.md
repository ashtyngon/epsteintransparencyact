A Fox News host has called on President Donald Trump to release records related to Jeffrey Epstein, according to a report published Saturday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The demand comes as Trump faces mounting questions about the disclosure of documents related to the late financier and convicted sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Fox News host's statement adds to ongoing debate over the release of Epstein-related files following the passage of federal transparency legislation.

## Pressure on White House

The Fox News host's call for document release represents a public challenge to the administration's handling of Epstein records.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The specific host making the statement and the exact nature of the demand were detailed in the UNILAD report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Trump signed the [Epstein Transparency Act into law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) in January 2026, requiring federal agencies to review and disclose records related to Epstein within 90 days unless specific exemptions apply. The law passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support before reaching the president's desk.

The [FBI began its review of Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) in late January following the law's enactment. Under the statute, agencies must identify records for disclosure while allowing redactions for national security, law enforcement, or privacy concerns.

## Epstein Case Background

Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting federal sex trafficking charges in a Manhattan jail cell. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner, though the circumstances have been the subject of ongoing scrutiny and public debate.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida involving solicitation of prostitution from a minor and served 13 months in county jail under a work-release program. Federal prosecutors in New York brought new charges against him in July 2019, alleging he operated a sex trafficking ring involving dozens of underage girls at his properties in Manhattan, Palm Beach, and New Mexico.

His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Maxwell's trial revealed extensive details about Epstein's network of powerful contacts and his abuse of underage victims over decades.

## Recent Developments

Multiple jurisdictions have taken new action in Epstein-related investigations in recent months. New Mexico authorities [reopened their probe of Epstein's Zorro Ranch](/news/2026-02-20-new-mexico-reopens-zorro-ranch-investigation-after-fbi-search-gap-revealed) after records showed gaps in the FBI's initial search of the property. The state attorney general also [opened a criminal investigation](/news/2026-02-19-new-mexico-ag-opens-criminal-probe-into-bodies-buried-at-epstein-ranch) into reports of human remains found at the ranch.

British authorities arrested Prince Andrew last week on document-sharing charges related to the Epstein case, marking the first criminal action against a member of the royal family in the scandal. Scotland Yard has [expanded its investigation](/news/2026-02-20-scotland-yard-expands-andrew-probe-questions-protection-officers-on-epstein-link) to include interviews with royal protection officers about potential evidence of Andrew's interactions with Epstein.

Federal prosecutors announced [no new charges](/news/2026-02-19-no-new-u-s-charges-after-latest-epstein-files-release) following a recent court release of Epstein-related documents, though the records contained hundreds of previously sealed pages of testimony and correspondence. The Epstein estate reached a [$25 million settlement](/news/2026-02-20-epstein-estate-settles-abuse-survivors-lawsuit-for-25m) with abuse survivors earlier this week.

The Epstein Transparency Act requires federal agencies to complete their review and begin releasing declassified records by April 2026. The law includes provisions for congressional oversight of the declassification process and public reporting on any records withheld from disclosure.
