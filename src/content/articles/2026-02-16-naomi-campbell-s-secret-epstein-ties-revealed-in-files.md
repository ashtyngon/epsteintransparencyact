A British supermodel maintained extensive contact with Jeffrey Epstein years after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to newly released documents. The files also detail how a prominent conservative strategist cultivated what appears to be a friendly relationship with the convicted sex offender, even as Epstein's crimes became public knowledge.

**Naomi Campbell** appears in the Department of Justice files far more frequently than previously known, with communications showing continued association with Epstein well into the 2010s. The documents reveal travel coordination, meeting arrangements, and what appears to be social planning between Campbell and Epstein's circle. Campbell had previously acknowledged knowing Epstein but characterized the relationship as limited.

The newly released records place Campbell's contact with Epstein in the context of his broader network of celebrity and business relationships that persisted after his 2008 guilty plea in Florida. In that case, Epstein admitted to procuring an underage girl for prostitution and served 13 months in county jail under a controversial work-release arrangement.

## Bannon's Post-Conviction Contact

**Steve Bannon**, the former White House chief strategist and conservative media figure, exchanged text messages with Epstein between 2017 and 2019, according to documents published by The New York Times. The texts suggest what the newspaper characterized as a "seemingly chummy relationship" that developed years after Epstein's conviction.

In a statement to the Times, Bannon said he engaged with Epstein "in the name of getting Mr. Epstein to open up." The nature of their discussions included at least one conversation about Pope Francis. According to [previous reporting](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files) on this site, the two men discussed "taking down" the pontiff.

Bannon's explanation that he was attempting to extract information from Epstein stands in contrast to the tone of the text exchanges, which the Times noted appeared friendly. The messages date from a period when Epstein's crimes were already public record but before his 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.

## DOJ Withholding Documents

**Rep. Thomas Massie** told The American Conservative that the Justice Department continues to withhold Epstein-related documents despite the federal disclosure law that mandated their release. Massie, who has emerged as one of Congress's most vocal critics of the document release process, said the DOJ has not complied with the full scope of the transparency law.

The Kentucky congressman previously [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files, and [accused Attorney General Pam Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) of avoiding eye contact with Epstein survivors during a congressional hearing. He also [ripped the Trump DOJ](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) over redactions that obscure key information.

According to a [recent study](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows), the Trump administration's Justice Department has released only 2% of Epstein-related files. The analysis examined the volume of documents released against estimates of the total materials the FBI and DOJ possess related to Epstein's criminal activities and network.

## British Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

Transparency International UK published an analysis examining what the Mandelson-Epstein emails reveal about Britain's lobbying regulations. The organization, which focuses on anti-corruption advocacy, used the case of **Peter Mandelson**, the former European Union trade commissioner who had contact with Epstein, to illustrate gaps in UK disclosure requirements.

Congress has [subpoenaed Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) over his Epstein ties. The emails show Mandelson communicated with Epstein on multiple occasions, including after the 2008 conviction. Mandelson has said he was unaware of the full extent of Epstein's crimes when they were in contact.

Transparency International's analysis notes that UK lobbying rules do not require disclosure of many types of influence activities. The organization argues that the Epstein files demonstrate how wealthy individuals can access political figures without triggering existing transparency mechanisms.

## International Investigations

Multiple countries have launched formal investigations into Epstein's connections with their nationals, according to The Independent. [France set up a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review the files for French citizens and opened a [probe into a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) whose name appeared in the documents.

The [UK police launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to examine potential trafficking allegations involving British citizens. The UK's top prosecutor said ["nobody is above the law"](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) as police began examining Prince Andrew's contacts with Epstein. New documents showed that [Prince Andrew's aide advised Epstein](/news/2026-02-14-prince-andrew-s-aide-advised-epstein-to-hide-conviction-on-visa-form) to hide his conviction on a visa application form.

India has named [an businessman, minister, and guru](/news/2026-02-14-indian-businessman-minister-guru-named-in-epstein-files) in its review of the files. The Indian government has not announced whether it will open formal investigations.

## Scale of Document Release

The Epstein files represent a massive document release, but The Sunday Guardian published an analysis showing they remain smaller in volume than the Pandora Papers, Panama Papers, and Paradise Papers. Those three leaks, focused on offshore financial structures and tax avoidance, each contained multiple terabytes of data.

The comparison provides context for understanding both the scope of the Epstein release and the technical challenges of document review. The Panama Papers alone included 11.5 million files from a single law firm. The Epstein files, by contrast, draw from multiple sources including FBI records, court documents, and email servers, but represent a more focused investigation into one individual's network.

Attorney General Bondi has [claimed the DOJ released "all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed) and provided a [list of 300 names](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release). However, Congress has [accused Bondi of "mudding" the list](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) by including deceased celebrities who had minimal documented contact with Epstein. Rep. Nancy Mace [accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) through redactions and incomplete disclosures.

## Previous Consequences

## Congressional Next Steps

Rep. Khanna [demanded names after a major associate stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down), saying Epstein's network ["knew enough to know better."](/news/2026-02-16-rep-khanna-epstein-s-network-knew-enough-to-know-better) Rep. Mace has [demanded unredacted co-conspirator files](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files).

Congress has also subpoenaed [Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands, who had extensive financial ties to Epstein. Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney over his financial affairs in the 1990s.

[Ghislaine Maxwell has offered](/news/2026-02-15-ghislaine-maxwell-offers-to-reveal-truth-in-exchange-for-clemency) to reveal additional information in exchange for clemency. Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, is currently serving a 20-year federal sentence for sex trafficking of minors. Her offer has not received public response from the Justice Department.

[UN experts called for an investigation](/news/2026-02-16-un-experts-call-for-investigation-into-epstein-files-warn-of-crimes-against-huma) into the Epstein files, warning of potential crimes against humanity. The experts, who work for UN human rights bodies, said the scale and nature of the alleged trafficking operation warrant international legal scrutiny.

A new platform called [JeffTube](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse) has made the DOJ Epstein files easier to browse by organizing the documents in a searchable database. The volunteer project aims to help journalists and researchers navigate the massive document release.
