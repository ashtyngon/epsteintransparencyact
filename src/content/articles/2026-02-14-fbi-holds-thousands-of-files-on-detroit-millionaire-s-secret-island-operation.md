The FBI holds thousands of files on Francis Shelden, a Detroit-area millionaire who operated on North Fox Island in Lake Michigan, decades before Jeffrey Epstein's activities on Little St. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands became public, according to The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Shelden, heir to a Michigan manufacturing fortune, purchased North Fox Island in the 1960s and was charged with abusing minors there in 1977, according to the report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He fled the United States before trial and reportedly died abroad in the 1990s without standing trial. The Independent reports that the FBI accumulated thousands of pages of documentation on Shelden's activities, but the full contents have never been released.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Investigation

A podcaster has reopened the cold case, describing what he characterizes as failures by Michigan law enforcement and the FBI, who had access to evidence in the 1970s, according to The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He spoke to the outlet about his efforts to piece together what happened on North Fox Island and why authorities did not act more aggressively despite accumulating extensive files.

The FBI continues to retain the thousands of pages on Shelden's island operation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The bureau has not announced plans to make them public, even as the Epstein Transparency Act -- signed November 19, 2025 -- has prompted broader public interest in how federal agencies handle documents related to alleged trafficking by wealthy individuals.

## Parallels to the Epstein Case

Shelden's use of a private island for alleged criminal activity predates Epstein's operations by decades. Both cases involve wealthy individuals who operated on remote, privately controlled islands, and in both cases law enforcement accumulated extensive documentation, according to The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The FBI has retained extensive documentation on Shelden without public release. The DOJ has released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos of Epstein-related files, but significant redactions remain. The Shelden files predate the Transparency Act and are not covered by its disclosure requirements.

The FBI has not commented on whether it plans to release the Shelden files or what they contain.
