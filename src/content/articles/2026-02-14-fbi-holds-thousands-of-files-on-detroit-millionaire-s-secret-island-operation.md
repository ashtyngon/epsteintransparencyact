The FBI holds thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire who built a secret operation on a private island in Lake Michigan—decades before Jeffrey Epstein's crimes became public.

The files document the activities of Francis Shelden, a wealthy bachelor who used the remote island location for what one podcaster now investigating the case describes as an operation authorities failed to stop. The Independent reports that the FBI accumulated extensive documentation but the full contents have never been released.

## The Investigation

A podcaster has reopened the cold case, working to expose what he says were failures by authorities who had access to evidence at the time. He spoke to The Independent about his efforts to piece together what happened on the island and why law enforcement did not act more aggressively.

The FBI continues to retain the thousands of files on Shelden's island operation. The bureau has not announced plans to make them public.

## Earlier Case

Shelden's use of a private island for a secret operation predates Epstein's activities by decades. Both cases involved wealthy individuals operating on remote, privately-controlled islands where normal oversight was limited.

The retention of extensive FBI documentation without public release follows a pattern seen in other high-profile cases. The podcaster's investigation focuses on why authorities with access to the files did not pursue fuller accountability when the case was active.

The FBI has not commented on whether it plans to release the Shelden files or what they contain.
