The FBI holds thousands of files on Francis Shelden, a Detroit-area millionaire who ran a secret operation on North Fox Island in Lake Michigan—decades before Jeffrey Epstein's crimes on Little St. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands became public.

Shelden, heir to a Michigan manufacturing fortune, purchased North Fox Island in the 1960s and used the remote, 3,400-acre island in Lake Michigan to abuse minors. He was charged in 1977 but fled the United States before trial, reportedly dying abroad in the 1990s without ever facing justice. The Independent reports that the FBI accumulated thousands of pages of documentation on Shelden's activities but the full contents have never been released.

## The Investigation

A podcaster has reopened the cold case, working to expose what he describes as failures by Michigan law enforcement and the FBI, who had access to evidence in the 1970s. He spoke to The Independent about his efforts to piece together what happened on North Fox Island and why authorities did not act more aggressively despite accumulating extensive files.

The FBI continues to retain the thousands of pages on Shelden's island operation. The bureau has not announced plans to make them public, even as the Epstein Transparency Act—signed November 19, 2025—has prompted broader public interest in how federal agencies handle documents related to trafficking by wealthy individuals.

## Parallels to the Epstein Case

Shelden's use of a private island for criminal activity predates Epstein's operations by decades. Both cases share core elements: wealthy individuals operating on remote, privately-controlled islands where normal oversight was limited, and law enforcement accumulating extensive documentation without securing full accountability.

Epstein purchased Little St. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1998 and used it as a base for trafficking minors. He died on August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted on December 29, 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

The retention of extensive FBI documentation on Shelden without public release follows a pattern that transparency advocates have criticized in the Epstein case as well. The DOJ has released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos of Epstein-related files, but significant redactions remain. The Shelden files predate the Transparency Act and are not covered by its disclosure requirements.

The FBI has not commented on whether it plans to release the Shelden files or what they contain.
