The FBI is sitting on more than 1,000 unreleased files connected to **Francis "Frank" Shelden**, a Detroit-area millionaire who ran a child abuse operation on a private island in Lake Michigan decades before **Jeffrey Epstein** used Little St. James Island for similar purposes, according to The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Shelden, a Yale graduate and descendant of former Michigan Gov. **Russell A. Alger**, purchased North Fox Island -- a remote, two-mile-wide landmass 19 miles off the Leelanau Peninsula -- for $20,000 in the early 1960s.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> He carved out an airstrip, built cabins in the woods and established a front organization called Brother Paul's Children's Mission, which advertised services for boys with reading problems and emotional counseling needs.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Authorities later determined that boys ages 7 to 16 were flown to the island by private plane and subjected to sexual abuse and child pornography production.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## How the Operation Collapsed

The scheme unraveled in July 1976 when the parent of a student at St. Joseph Catholic School in Port Huron reported **Gerald Richards**, a gym teacher and traveling magician who recruited victims for Shelden's operation.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Richards pleaded guilty to first-degree criminal sexual conduct on Sept. 13, 1976, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. In exchange for immunity, he testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency in 1977, disclosing the scope of the North Fox Island operation and how the ring recruited children.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Michigan State Police raided Shelden's Ann Arbor home, but Shelden and another associate, **Dyer Grossman**, had already fled the country in 1976.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Shelden relocated to the Netherlands, which at the time did not have an extradition treaty covering child sexual conduct offenses. He reportedly married a French woman to obtain citizenship and continued offending across Europe, according to investigators cited by The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Reports indicate Shelden died in Amsterdam in 1996 without ever standing trial.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## FBI Files and FOIA Lawsuit

Documentary filmmaker **Colin Browen**, host of the podcasts "The Paranormal Files" and "Murder in America," has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for more than 1,047 unreleased FBI records related to Shelden.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> When the bureau told him processing and redaction could take more than six years, Browen sued for access.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The FBI has posted a partial Shelden file in its online Vault reading room, but the bulk of the records remain classified.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Browen and investigative journalist **J. Reuben Appelman**, author of "The Kill Jar," are producing a docuseries on the Shelden case set for release later this year.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Parallels to the Epstein Case

The structural similarities between the two cases are difficult to overlook. Both Shelden and Epstein used private islands shielded by wealth and geographic isolation to facilitate abuse, and in both instances federal agencies accumulated extensive documentation that remained largely inaccessible to the public for years.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The [Epstein Transparency Act, signed Nov. 19, 2025](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law/), prompted the DOJ to release 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos of Epstein-related files. However, the Shelden records predate the act and are not covered by its disclosure requirements. The FBI has not commented on whether it intends to release the Shelden files or what they contain.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The North Fox Island case also remains linked to the unsolved Oakland County Child Killer murders of 1976-77, in which four children were killed in suburban Detroit. Investigators have long examined possible connections between those homicides and Shelden's trafficking ring, though no charges have resulted.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Michigan purchased North Fox Island in 2000. The state has not commented on the renewed federal interest in the Shelden files.
