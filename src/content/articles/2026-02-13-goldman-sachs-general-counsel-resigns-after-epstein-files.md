# Goldman Sachs General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler Resigns After Epstein Files Appearance

**Kathryn Ruemmler** is resigning from her position as general counsel at **Goldman Sachs** following her appearance in the Epstein files, according to **CBS News**. Ruemmler, who previously served as White House counsel under former President **Barack Obama**, is stepping down from the Wall Street firm after documents linked her to the Epstein case.

The resignation comes amid continued public scrutiny of individuals named in released Epstein-related documents. Ruemmler's connection to Jeffrey Epstein surfaced in court filings and flight logs that have been made public in recent years, raising questions about her professional relationship with the convicted sex offender.

## Ruemmler's Background and Role

Ruemmler held one of the most senior legal positions at Goldman Sachs as general counsel. Before joining the investment bank, she served in the Obama White House from **2011 to 2014** as White House counsel, one of the administration's top legal roles.

Her name appeared in documents related to the Epstein case, though the specific nature and extent of her connections detailed in those files remains a subject of public interest. The timing of her resignation suggests a connection between the document disclosures and her departure from Goldman Sachs.

## Implications for Corporate Leadership

The resignation highlights the ongoing professional consequences for individuals named in the Epstein files, even years after the financier's death in **2019**. Major corporations continue to face reputational challenges when executives are linked to Epstein in released court documents.

Goldman Sachs has not yet announced a replacement for Ruemmler's position. The departure of such a senior legal officer represents a significant leadership change for the financial institution.

## What's Next

It remains unclear whether additional documents naming Ruemmler will be released as part of ongoing Epstein-related court proceedings. The announcement date of her resignation was **February 12, 2026**. Goldman Sachs will need to appoint a new general counsel to fill the vacancy.
