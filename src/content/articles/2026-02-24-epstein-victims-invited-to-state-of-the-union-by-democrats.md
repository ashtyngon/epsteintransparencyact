Democratic members of Congress have invited survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse to attend President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, according to The New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The invitations represent an effort by Democratic lawmakers to spotlight issues including Epstein's crimes and the administration's immigration policies during the annual presidential address to a joint session of Congress.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Each member of Congress receives a limited number of tickets to distribute to guests for the State of the Union, which takes place in the House chamber.

## Epstein Survivors Among Invited Guests

The Times reported that Epstein victims are among those invited by Democratic lawmakers to attend the address.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The specific identities of the survivors and which members extended the invitations were not disclosed in the report.

The invitations come as Congress continues to press for transparency regarding Epstein's connections to prominent figures in government and business. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) recently stated that released Epstein files reveal a ["much bigger" criminal network](/news/2026-02-24-rep-mace-epstein-files-reveal-much-bigger-criminal-network) than previously understood, while Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) has alleged that [the Department of Justice withheld FBI interviews](/news/2026-02-24-rep-garcia-doj-withheld-fbi-interviews-with-trump-accuser-in-epstein-files) with a Trump accuser in materials released under the Epstein Transparency Act.

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges of soliciting a minor under a controversial non-prosecution agreement that allowed him to avoid federal charges at that time.

## Immigration Policy Victim Also Invited

The Times also reported that Democratic lawmakers invited Erika Kirk to the address.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Kirk is identified in the Times report as a victim of Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement policies, though specific details about her case were not provided in the article. The inclusion of Kirk on the guest list signals Democratic opposition to the administration's immigration crackdown.

## Olympic Athletes on Guest List

Members of the U.S. Olympic hockey team were also invited by Democratic lawmakers to attend the address.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The specific hockey players invited and which lawmakers extended the invitations were not specified in the report.

The inclusion of Olympic athletes on State of the Union guest lists follows a longstanding tradition of inviting sports figures and other prominent Americans to the annual address. Athletes who have represented the United States in international competition are frequently honored at such events.

## Congressional Guest Lists as Political Messaging

Members of both parties routinely use State of the Union guest lists to draw attention to policy priorities and political positions. Guests are typically seated in the gallery above the House floor and are often acknowledged during the president's remarks or in media coverage surrounding the event.

The practice allows lawmakers to personalize policy debates by featuring individuals directly affected by government actions or inaction. Previous State of the Union addresses have included crime victims, military service members, small business owners, and individuals impacted by various policy decisions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The choice to invite Epstein survivors indicates Democratic lawmakers' intention to maintain focus on the case and outstanding questions about Epstein's network of associates. The FBI began its review of Epstein-related records following passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, which Trump signed into law requiring federal agencies to declassify and release documents related to the case.

The State of the Union address provides a high-profile platform for lawmakers to demonstrate their legislative priorities through their selection of guests. The annual event draws significant media attention, making guest invitations a visible form of political messaging. Democratic lawmakers' selection of Epstein survivors for Tuesday's address places the ongoing questions about the case and its broader implications in the national spotlight during one of the year's most-watched political events.
