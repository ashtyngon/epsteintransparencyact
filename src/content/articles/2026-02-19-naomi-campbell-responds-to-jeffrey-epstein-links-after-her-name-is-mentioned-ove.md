Supermodel **Naomi Campbell** has publicly responded to her connections to **Jeffrey Epstein** after a review by The New York Times found her name appears in nearly 300 documents released by the Department of Justice, including some duplicate entries.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Campbell addressed the matter on her Instagram Stories on Feb. 15, writing: "I said it in 2019, and I'll say it again now: don't come at me when there is no wrongdoing on my part," referencing the period when her name was first publicly linked to Epstein after his arrest.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> She added that she stood "in complete solidarity with the courageous survivors."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The supermodel's connections to Epstein had been [previously documented in released files](/news/2026-02-15-naomi-campbell-s-epstein-ties-exposed-in-released-files/) when the initial batch of records emerged in late January.

## What the Documents Show

Recently released email exchanges indicate Campbell requested to travel on Epstein's private jet and planned to meet him at his New York mansion, according to The Tab and The New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Events she invited Epstein to included her 2004 birthday party in St. Tropez, a party at a Dolce & Gabbana store in Paris celebrating her 25 years with the brand, and a NEON event she co-hosted with **Dasha Zhukova**. Two of these events took place after Epstein was released from prison following his 2008 guilty plea to soliciting a minor.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

One document titled "List of People Who Need JE's Address!" lists Campbell among several dozen people under instructions on how to mail letters, postcards and books to the Florida jail where Epstein began serving his sentence in the summer of 2008.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Federal investigators' interviews with unnamed victims state that Epstein introduced them to Campbell at social gatherings and that they saw her at his mansion and on his private island, according to FBI interview transcripts in the files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Epstein appeared to invoke his association with Campbell when recruiting young women, suggesting a modeling career was within reach.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Campbell's Legal Defense

Attorney **Martin Singer**, representing Campbell, stated that prior to Epstein's 2019 arrest in New York, his client "knew nothing about his appalling criminal conduct."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Singer said Campbell was living in Moscow between 2008 and 2013 and "had no idea that Epstein was a registered sex offender."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Singer added that Campbell was never under contract with Victoria's Secret, and that if Epstein invoked her name to build trust with others, "he did that entirely without her knowledge or authorization."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

There is no evidence in the files tying Campbell to any criminal conduct, and she has not been accused of wrongdoing.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Background

Campbell's response comes as numerous public figures named in the Epstein documents have issued statements addressing their past associations with the financier. The [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law/), signed into law in November 2025, mandated the DOJ release government records related to Epstein's criminal activities, resulting in the disclosure of more than 3 million pages on January 30, 2026.
