The FBI maintains thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire who operated a secret facility on a private island in Lake Michigan decades before Jeffrey Epstein's crimes became public, according to a podcaster investigating the cold case.

Frank Shelden built the operation on North Fox Island, a remote location accessible only by boat or plane. The FBI's document cache on Shelden and his island remains in the bureau's possession but has not been released to the public.

A podcaster told The Independent he is working to expose what authorities failed to do in the case and to obtain access to the FBI's files on the North Fox Island operation.

## Document Retention Without Release

The Shelden files illustrate how the FBI retains extensive records on historical cases without making them public. The bureau has [cited privacy concerns and ongoing investigative interests](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) to justify withholding documents in other cases, including the Epstein investigation.

The [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) mandates release of Epstein-related files but does not cover pre-2000 cases or other instances of organized abuse. No comparable legislation requires the FBI to disclose its holdings on the North Fox Island operation.

## Cold Case Investigation

The podcaster's investigation has renewed attention to a case that largely dropped from public view. The FBI's possession of thousands of pages suggests extensive investigative activity that has not entered the public record.

Congressional scrutiny of FBI document practices has intensified following the Epstein file releases. [Representative Thomas Massie and others](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) have challenged the bureau's rationale for extensive redactions and delayed disclosures in cases where the principals are deceased.

## Island Operations and Institutional Knowledge

Both Shelden and Epstein used private islands to create geographic isolation. Epstein operated from Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands and maintained other properties including a New Mexico ranch. Shelden's North Fox Island sits in Lake Michigan, providing similar remoteness.

The FBI's files on the Shelden case could contain investigative methods and institutional knowledge about how authorities approached similar operations in earlier decades. Those records remain inaccessible despite the case being closed.

## Questions About Accountability

The podcaster's work raises questions about what the FBI documented in its investigation and why the files remain sealed. [Attorney General Pam Bondi has faced congressional pressure](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) to explain the DOJ's approach to releasing historical documents on organized abuse networks.

The North Fox Island files preceded digital recordkeeping and modern transparency requirements. The FBI has provided no timeline for reviewing the documents or making them public.

The case represents an earlier chapter in the institutional response to wealthy individuals who used private properties to facilitate abuse. The thousands of pages in FBI custody document that response but remain out of public view.
