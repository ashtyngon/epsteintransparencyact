The document releases following the Epstein Transparency Act have identified political operatives, university administrators, and others who sought donations or access from the convicted sex offender after his 2008 conviction.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Newly released Justice Department records show that **Dynamic SRG**, a Democratic political consulting firm, repeatedly solicited donations from Epstein to fund House races in New York, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/nyregion/epstein-donations-democrats-hochul-jeffries.html).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The consultants offered access to top New York Democratic politicians in return. The solicitations were "apparently unsuccessful" -- there is no evidence Epstein donated, according to the Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Consulting Firm's Outreach

**Dynamic SRG**, according to DOJ records reviewed by the Times, approached Epstein multiple times about contributing to Democratic House races.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

These solicitations occurred after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Palm Beach County to soliciting prostitution from a minor -- a plea deal negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta with Epstein's defense team, which included Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The deal resulted in 13 months of county jail with work release and required Epstein to register as a sex offender.

The Times reported that the solicitations were "apparently unsuccessful."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## University Contacts

New DOJ records indicate that **Jeffrey Epstein helped arrange a guest speaker at the University of Alabama**, according to reporting by WVTM.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The details remain limited.

This adds to a broader pattern documented in previous Epstein file releases. As previously reported, [college presidents and professors were named in Epstein files](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout), documenting contacts between Epstein and academic institutions after his 2008 conviction.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## The Dispute Over Redactions

These records about post-conviction relationships with Epstein come amid [a dispute over the DOJ's handling of the files](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release). Attorney General **Pam Bondi** faced [approximately five hours of questioning on Wednesday](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release), defending the department's decision to redact documents and end further releases.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

According to Axios, multiple MAGA-aligned commentators have called for Bondi's removal over her handling of the files.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Deputy Attorney General **Todd Blanche** accused Reps. **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) and **Thomas Massie** (R-Ky.) of naming "completely random people" in relation to the Epstein investigation, according to The Hill.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Khanna and Massie have led a bipartisan effort to release all files, with Massie naming six individuals on the House floor.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

During Wednesday's hearing, **Rep. Ted Lieu** (D-Calif.) accused Bondi of lying under oath about Trump and Epstein's past acquaintance. Bondi rejected the accusation.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Epstein survivors who attended Wednesday's hearing said they had not been given the opportunity to provide testimony to the DOJ under Bondi's leadership, according to reporting.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Corporate Departures

**Kathryn Ruemmler**, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned after emails appeared in the files, according to PBS NewsHour.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> The emails reportedly showed her referring to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey."<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

This follows a series of departures as the files have made previously undisclosed contacts public. Rep. Thomas Massie commented on one such departure, according to Spectrum News.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## The Wexner Connection

**Les Wexner**, the billionaire founder of Limited Brands (now L Brands) and Epstein's only confirmed financial client, gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion at 9 East 71st Street to Epstein for $0, according to public records.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup> Wexner has been called to testify by Congress, and Rep. Massie referred to him as a "co-conspirator" on the House floor.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Reporting from WFMJ in Ohio found that **Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner**.<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>

## Post-Conviction Contacts

The documents show that after Epstein's 2008 conviction -- after he was required to register as a sex offender -- some institutions and individuals continued to interact with him, according to the files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Political consultants solicited him for campaign contributions. Universities maintained contact. Corporate executives had ongoing correspondence, according to the documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein's conviction was public information at the time of these contacts.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Unanswered Questions

Several questions remain:

The number of firms and operatives that sought Epstein's money or offered access in return has not been established. The files released so far represent a portion of DOJ holdings.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Whether any politicians met with Epstein as a result of these solicitations is unknown. The Times reported that the donations were unsuccessful, but unsuccessful donations do not preclude meetings from having occurred.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The full scope of universities' post-conviction interactions with Epstein has not been determined. The University of Alabama speaker arrangement is one documented instance.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The DOJ's criteria for continued redactions remain disputed. Deputy AG Blanche's characterization of named individuals as "completely random people" has been contested by lawmakers who say the individuals have documented Epstein connections.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Ongoing Disclosure

Attorney General Bondi has stated that privacy concerns and ongoing investigations justify the redactions. University of Virginia politics professor Larry Sabato described the files as "a festering sore" for the administration, according to NPR.<sup>[10](#ref-10)</sup>

Public pressure for full disclosure has continued. The Dynamic SRG records and the University of Alabama documents represent contacts that occurred after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea. The full scope of these post-conviction institutional contacts will remain unknown until additional files are released.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
