In the shadow of Jeffrey Epstein's death, a new cast of characters has emerged from the document releases that followed the Epstein Transparency Act—not as alleged co-conspirators or enablers, but as political operatives, university administrators, and power brokers who saw the convicted sex offender as a potential source of funding, access, or prestige. The files document that even after Epstein's 2008 conviction, institutions and consultants continued to court his money and connections, treating him as another wealthy donor rather than a registered sex offender.

Newly released Justice Department records show that **Dynamic SRG**, a Democratic political consulting firm, repeatedly solicited donations from Epstein to fund House races in New York, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/nyregion/epstein-donations-democrats-hochul-jeffries.html). The consultants offered access to top New York Democratic politicians in return. The solicitations appear to have been unsuccessful—there's no evidence Epstein donated—but the fact that they occurred at all has drawn scrutiny from both lawmakers and the public.

This wasn't an isolated lapse. From university speaking arrangements to political fundraising, the Epstein files paint a picture of a post-conviction period where parts of America's elite infrastructure publicly distanced themselves from Epstein while privately continuing to seek his money and connections.

## The Consulting Firm That Sold Access

**Dynamic SRG**'s repeated outreach to Epstein is an example of the access-for-dollars culture in American politics. The consulting firm, according to DOJ records reviewed by the Times, approached Epstein multiple times about contributing to Democratic House races.

The implicit offer was clear: donate, and you'll get face time with rising Democratic stars. This was years after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Palm Beach County to soliciting prostitution from a minor — a plea deal negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta with Epstein's defense team, which included Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr. The deal resulted in just 13 months of county jail with work release and required Epstein to register as a sex offender.

The consultants proceeded with this arrangement despite Epstein's criminal record. Political fundraising operates in a gray zone where wealthy donors routinely receive access in exchange for contributions. But Epstein wasn't a typical wealthy donor. He was a convicted sex offender whose crimes involved minors.

The Times reported that the solicitations were "apparently unsuccessful." That Epstein did not donate does not change the fact that political operatives were willing to facilitate his re-entry into elite circles and into the company of elected officials, despite his status as a convicted sex offender.

## Universities and the Epstein Brand

While political consultants chased Epstein's money, universities—institutions supposedly devoted to ethical inquiry and the pursuit of truth—maintained their own problematic relationships with the financier.

New DOJ records allege that **Jeffrey Epstein helped arrange a guest speaker at the University of Alabama**, according to reporting by WVTM. The details remain sparse, but the allegation fits a broader pattern documented in previous Epstein file releases: universities accepting his money, hosting his events, and treating him as a legitimate philanthropist despite his criminal record.

This occurred in the context already revealed by earlier reporting on this site. As previously documented, [college presidents and professors were named in Epstein files](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout), exposing the extensive ties between Epstein and academic institutions.

Universities have long grappled with the problem of tainted money. Do you accept donations from unethical sources if the funds support legitimate research? The Epstein case presents an extreme version of this dilemma. His money didn't just come from questionable business practices—it was accumulated by someone convicted of sex crimes against minors.

Yet institutions continued to welcome him. They gave him offices, hosted his conferences, and provided the patina of academic legitimacy that helped rehabilitate his public image. The University of Alabama speaker arrangement, if confirmed, would be another data point in a depressing trend.

## The Political Firestorm Over Redactions

These new revelations about post-conviction relationships with Epstein land amid [an intensifying political battle over the DOJ's handling of the files](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release). Attorney General **Pam Bondi** faced [five hours of hostile questioning on Wednesday](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release), defending the department's decision to heavily redact documents and end further releases.

Now even voices from MAGA world—typically loyal to the Trump administration—are calling for Bondi's removal. According to Axios, "a chorus of top MAGA voices" are demanding accountability over her handling of the files and her "combative congressional testimony."

The fracture in the conservative coalition reflects broader public frustration. As Axios noted: "Americans' thirst for answers and additional prosecutions persists, cracking the conservative coalition and causing a headache for President Trump."

Deputy Attorney General **Todd Blanche** tried to push back on Friday, accusing Reps. **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) and **Thomas Massie** (R-Ky.) of naming "completely random people" in relation to the Epstein investigation, according to The Hill. Khanna and Massie have led [a bipartisan effort to release all files](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act), with Massie specifically [naming six individuals on the House floor](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act).

Blanche's characterization—calling the named individuals "completely random people"—itself became controversial. If these people are truly random, why the intense DOJ resistance to releasing their names? And if they're not random—if they have genuine connections to Epstein's operations—then why is the DOJ defending them?

The tension escalated during Wednesday's hearing when **Rep. Ted Lieu** (D-Calif.) accused Bondi of lying under oath about Trump and Epstein's past relationship. Bondi "forcefully rejected" the accusation, but the exchange illustrated how politically toxic the files have become.

Epstein survivors who attended Wednesday's hearing reported they had not been given the opportunity to provide testimony to the DOJ under Bondi's leadership. When prompted to acknowledge their presence, Bondi refused.

## The Corporate Exodus Continues

While political and legal battles rage in Washington, the corporate world continues to feel Epstein's posthumous impact. **Kathryn Ruemmler**, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned after emails revealed her close relationship with Epstein, according to PBS NewsHour. The emails reportedly showed her referring to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey."

This follows [a wave of high-profile resignations](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) as the files expose previously hidden connections. Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie commented on one such resignation, according to Spectrum News, though details of which CEO he referenced were not specified in the available reporting.

The pattern is clear: corporate boards are no longer willing to tolerate executives with unexplained Epstein ties. The reputational risk has become too severe. Where the justice system has failed to hold people accountable, public pressure and corporate governance structures are beginning to fill the gap.

## The Wexner Factor

Behind much of the current congressional scrutiny stands **Les Wexner**, the billionaire founder of Limited Brands (now L Brands) and Epstein's only confirmed financial client. Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion at 9 East 71st Street to Epstein for $0 — one of the largest residential property transfers in New York City history. Wexner has been [subpoenaed by Congress](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and [labeled a potential co-conspirator](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) by Rep. Massie.

New reporting from WFMJ in Ohio reveals that **Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner**, raising questions about whether financial relationships influenced oversight or investigation of Epstein's operations.

The Wexner connection illustrates a central challenge in the Epstein case: how do you investigate someone who was deeply embedded in elite social, financial, and political networks? Every thread you pull reveals another connection, another relationship, another institution that looked the other way.

## What This Pattern Reveals

Taken together, these documents reveal a pattern. These new documents show that after Epstein's 2008 conviction—after he was required to register as a sex offender, after his crimes were a matter of public record—significant parts of America's institutional infrastructure continued to do business with him.

Political consultants offered him access to elected officials in exchange for campaign contributions. Universities welcomed his involvement in academic events. Corporate executives maintained close relationships that they described in familial terms.

This wasn't a case of powerful people being fooled by a con man. Epstein's conviction was public information. These institutions and individuals continued the association despite his status as a convicted sex offender.

The Dynamic SRG case is particularly revealing because it's so transactional. There was no pretense of friendship or long-standing relationship. These were political operatives who saw Epstein as a potential source of campaign cash and were willing to facilitate his access to Democratic politicians to get it.

## The Questions That Remain

As the political battle over file releases continues, several critical questions remain unanswered:

**First**, the number of firms and operatives like Dynamic SRG that courted Epstein's money and offered access in return has not been established. The files released so far represent a fraction of DOJ holdings. Additional transactional relationships may be documented in redacted or unreleased materials.

**Second**, whether any politicians actually met with Epstein as a result of these solicitations is unknown. The Times reported that the donations were unsuccessful, but unsuccessful donations do not preclude meetings from having occurred.

**Third**, the full role of universities in Epstein's post-conviction rehabilitation has not been determined. The University of Alabama speaker arrangement is one documented allegation. The number of other academic institutions that provided platforms or access has not been established.

**Fourth**, the DOJ's resistance to releasing additional files has not been adequately explained. Deputy AG Blanche's characterization of named individuals as "completely random people" has been contested by lawmakers who say the individuals have documented Epstein connections.

**Fifth**, the number of people currently in positions of power who maintained relationships with Epstein after his conviction is unknown. The pace of resignations indicates the total may exceed those publicly identified so far.

## The Transparency Imperative

The Epstein case has become a test of whether American institutions can police themselves and whether the public will have access to information about how power really operates.

[Attorney General Bondi claims](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) that privacy concerns and ongoing investigations justify the extensive redactions. But as [University of Virginia politics professor Larry Sabato noted](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/14/nx-s1-5714031/epstein-files-massie-bondi-doj), the files have become a "festering sore" for the administration.

Public pressure for full disclosure has continued despite the DOJ's position that its releases are complete.

The Dynamic SRG revelations and the University of Alabama allegations represent a category of conduct distinct from direct participation in Epstein's crimes: institutions and individuals who continued to seek his money and connections after his conviction.

Political consultants offered him access, universities welcomed his involvement, and executives maintained relationships -- all after his 2008 guilty plea. The full scope of these post-conviction institutional relationships will remain unknown until additional files are released.
