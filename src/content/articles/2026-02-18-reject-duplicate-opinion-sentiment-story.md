Almost seven in ten Americans say the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein demonstrates that powerful individuals are rarely held accountable, according to a poll reported by WFLA.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The poll findings reflect public perception of accountability in the Epstein case following recent document releases. WFLA did not provide additional details about the poll's methodology, sample size, timing, or margin of error in its report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Multiple sets of Epstein-related documents have been released through court proceedings in recent years. Court filings in civil litigation were unsealed in batches starting in 2019. Additional documents have been released following Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 conviction on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in early 2026, [mandated the release of federal government records](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) related to Epstein's case. The law requires federal agencies to review and disclose documents within specified timeframes.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. Ghislaine Maxwell remains the only person convicted of crimes directly related to Epstein's sex trafficking operation, receiving a 20-year federal prison sentence in 2022.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Multiple prominent figures have faced scrutiny after being identified in flight logs, visitor records, or other documents connected to Epstein. [Twelve individuals resigned from various positions](/news/2026-02-17-full-list-of-politicians-royals-named-in-epstein-files-released) after being named in recently released files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
