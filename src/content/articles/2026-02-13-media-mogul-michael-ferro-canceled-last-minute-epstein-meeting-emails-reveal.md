This week, Deputy Attorney General **Todd Blanche** accused two congressmen of naming "completely random people" with no documented ties to **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to The Hill.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> At the same time, a Goldman Sachs general counsel resigned and corporate executives at multiple companies departed in succession.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The events highlight the challenge of processing the largest document release of its kind in American history without an agreed-upon standard for what constitutes evidence of a meaningful connection versus an incidental mention.

Attorney General **Pam Bondi** [testified before Congress](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) this week in a roughly five-hour hearing.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Survivors attended; Bondi did not acknowledge them when prompted, according to reporting.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Democrats accused her of lying under oath.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> According to Axios, multiple MAGA-aligned commentators have called for her removal.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> University of Virginia politics expert **Larry Sabato** described the Epstein files as "a festering sore" for President Trump.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## The Collateral Damage Mounts

Professional consequences for those named in the files have followed quickly.

**Goldman Sachs** announced Friday that its general counsel is resigning after emails showed what PBS NewsHour described as a relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Other departures include [a Dubai port CEO who left](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after appearing in thousands of documents and [university presidents and professors](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) named in the files. Peter Mandelson, Britain's former ambassador to the United States, now faces a congressional request to testify.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

**Michael Ferro**, former chairman of both the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times, appears in newly released emails showing he canceled a meeting with Epstein "at the last minute," according to the Chicago Tribune.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The correspondence places Ferro among those whose names have appeared in the files.

In Alabama, DOJ records indicate that Epstein helped arrange a guest speaker at the **University of Alabama**, according to WVTM.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

## Inaccurate Identifications

Not everyone named in the files has documented ties to Epstein.

Deputy Attorney General Blanche accused Reps. **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) and **Thomas Massie** (R-Ky.) of naming "completely random people" during floor speeches, according to The Hill.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The Guardian reported Friday that **four men named by Khanna in unredacted files have no documented ties to Epstein**.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>

Their names are now in the public record. This is a consequence of releasing millions of documents -- emails, flight logs, phone records, correspondence spanning decades -- without full context or verification.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup> The Justice Department's heavily redacted approach has been criticized by transparency advocates, but as this week demonstrated, naming individuals without verification also carries risks for those with no documented wrongdoing.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## The DOJ Hearing

During Wednesday's hearing, Bondi faced questions about why DOJ ended its release of Epstein documents.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Survivors of Epstein's abuse attended the hearing. All said they had not been given the opportunity to provide testimony to DOJ under Bondi's leadership, according to reporting.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> When Rep. **Ted Lieu** (D-Calif.) prompted her to acknowledge their presence, she did not do so. When Lieu accused her of lying under oath regarding Trump and Epstein's prior acquaintance, she rejected the claim.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The Epstein files contain millions of pages. Some document alleged criminal conduct. Others are mundane business correspondence or contacts made without knowledge of Epstein's alleged crimes.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The distinction between these categories has not been consistently made in public discourse.

## The Documented Pattern

The documents show Epstein maintained relationships across multiple sectors. Those relationships ranged, according to available evidence, from close personal contact to casual acquaintance to people who accepted donations or attended events.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The files do not always distinguish between these categories.

Congressional investigations into Les Wexner, legal proceedings against Bank of America, and departures at Goldman Sachs and DP World represent one category of response. The Ferro emails and the University of Alabama records represent another: Epstein's name appearing in institutional contexts through professional channels.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Being named in the files does not establish wrongdoing. But it has resulted in significant professional consequences for multiple individuals.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## What Comes Next

**Peter Mandelson** has been asked to testify before Congress. Lawmakers Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam wrote that the former ambassador "holds critical information" for their investigation, according to The Hill.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Whether he will appear has not been confirmed.

**The DOJ's redaction policy** remains contested. Bondi has stated that releasing unredacted files would violate privacy laws. Critics, including some in Trump's coalition, argue that selective redaction protects individuals who should face scrutiny.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

**The accuracy of congressional name disclosures** has been questioned. Khanna's naming of four individuals with no documented Epstein ties, as confirmed by The Guardian, demonstrates the risk of disclosing names without full verification.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>

Multiple questions remain unanswered: how many others may have been named incorrectly; which relationships documented in the files reflect substantive contact versus incidental mention; and what information is still being withheld and on what basis.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Joe Rogan — whose name appeared in a 2017 email where Epstein asked physicist Lawrence Krauss to introduce them, though Rogan never responded and no meeting occurred — stated this week that the Epstein files "scare the hell out of me."<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>
