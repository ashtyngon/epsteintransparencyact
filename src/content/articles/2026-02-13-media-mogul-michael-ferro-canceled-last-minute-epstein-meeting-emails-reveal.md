The names kept coming—splashed across congressional speeches, leaked in emails, surfacing in millions of newly released documents. But not all of them belonged. This week, Deputy Attorney General **Todd Blanche** accused two congressmen of naming "completely random people" with no actual ties to **Jeffrey Epstein**, even as a top Goldman Sachs lawyer resigned and corporate executives across the globe resigned in succession. The result is that nearly three years after Epstein's death, Congress, the Justice Department, and the public lack an agreed-upon standard for what constitutes evidence versus innuendo in the largest document release of its kind in American history.

The fracture is no longer partisan. It extends to the institutions tasked with delivering accountability.

At the center of the storm sits Attorney General **Pam Bondi**, whose [combative testimony before Congress](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) this week lasted roughly five hours and satisfied precisely no one. Survivors attended; Bondi refused to acknowledge them when prompted. Democrats accused her of lying under oath. And now, according to Axios, a chorus of top MAGA voices are calling for her removal—fracturing the conservative coalition and creating what University of Virginia politics expert **Larry Sabato** calls "a festering sore" for President Trump.

## The Collateral Damage Mounts

While Washington fights over who knew what, the professional consequences for those named—accurately or not—have been swift.

**Goldman Sachs** announced Friday that its top lawyer is resigning after emails showed what PBS NewsHour described as "her close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein." The revelation follows a pattern of high-profile departures documented on this site: [a Dubai port CEO forced out](/articles/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after appearing in thousands of documents, [university presidents and professors](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) placed on leave, and Peter Mandelson—Britain's former ambassador to the United States—[now facing congressional subpoena](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe).

This week brought two more casualties from the media world. **Michael Ferro**, former chairman of both the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times, appears in newly released emails showing he canceled a meeting with Epstein "at the last minute," according to the Chicago Tribune. The correspondence adds Ferro to a growing list of prominent figures whose proximity to Epstein—however tangential—is now under public scrutiny.

And in Alabama, DOJ records revealed that Epstein allegedly helped arrange a guest speaker at the **University of Alabama**, according to WVTM. The allegation underscores Epstein's reach into academic institutions, a pattern that has forced multiple university officials to resign or face investigation in recent weeks.

## When Congressional Transparency Becomes Congressional Recklessness

Not everyone named in the files has documented ties to Epstein.

Deputy Attorney General Blanche's accusation—that Reps. **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) and **Thomas Massie** (R-Ky.) revealed names of "completely random people" during [floor speeches demanding transparency](/articles/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act)—isn't just political spin. The Guardian confirmed it Friday, reporting that **four men named by Khanna in unredacted files have no ties to Epstein**.

A sitting congressman, in pursuit of transparency, named four people with no documented ties to Epstein in connection with one of the largest document-release scandals in modern American history.

The damage is done. Their names are now in the public record, linked forever to Epstein in news archives, social media posts, and Google search results. Whether those men can rebuild their reputations is an open question. Whether they have grounds for legal action against Khanna is another.

This is a consequence of releasing millions of documents—emails, flight logs, phone records, correspondence spanning decades—without adequate context, verification, or explanation. The Justice Department's heavily redacted approach [has been criticized as a cover-up](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions). But the alternative, as this week demonstrated, carries its own risks: individuals with no documented wrongdoing have been publicly named and linked to Epstein based on incomplete data.

## The DOJ's Impossible Position—And Its Own Making

Attorney General Bondi's predicament is partly of her own making. During Wednesday's hearing, she faced pointed questions about why DOJ [ended its release of Epstein documents](/articles/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) and whether the administration is protecting powerful figures.

Survivors of Epstein's abuse attended the hearing. All said they had not been given the opportunity to provide testimony to DOJ under Bondi's leadership. When Rep. **Ted Lieu** (D-Calif.) prompted her to acknowledge their presence, she refused. When Lieu accused her of lying under oath regarding Trump and Epstein's former relationship, she forcefully rejected the claim.

But Bondi also faces an impossible standard. The Epstein files contain millions of pages. Some document serious criminal conduct. Others are mundane business correspondence, social pleasantries, or contacts made without knowledge of Epstein's crimes. The difference matters—legally, ethically, and practically.

Without that differentiation, the files become a weapon. This week, they were wielded by Congress against executives, lawyers, and academics. Next week, they could be wielded against anyone whose email address appears in the wrong place at the wrong time.

[The Epstein Transparency Act](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), signed into law to force accountability, has also created situations where the mere appearance of a name in the files is treated as evidence of guilt, regardless of context.

## The Pattern That Emerges

When you synthesize this week's revelations with the months of reporting that preceded it, a clearer picture emerges—not of a vast criminal conspiracy, but of a pattern of **elite access and institutional failure**.

Epstein cultivated relationships with power. That's documented and undeniable. But those relationships ranged from co-conspirators to casual acquaintances to people who accepted donations or attended events without knowledge of his crimes. The files don't always distinguish between these categories. Neither, increasingly, does public discourse.

[Congressional investigations into Les Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-to-depose-wexner-in-ohio-over-epstein-ties), [legal battles against Bank of America](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed), and [resignations at Goldman Sachs and DP World](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) tell part of this story. But the Ferro emails and the University of Alabama revelation tell another: Epstein embedded himself in institutions—media, academia, finance—through seemingly ordinary professional channels.

That access didn't make everyone complicit. But it did make everyone vulnerable—to blackmail, to association, to the kind of reputational destruction that's unfolding now.

## What Comes Next: Accountability Without Annihilation

The next phase of the Epstein reckoning will determine whether American institutions can thread an impossible needle: delivering justice to survivors while protecting the innocent from collateral damage.

**Peter Mandelson's upcoming congressional testimony** will be watched closely. Lawmakers Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam wrote that it's "clear the former US ambassador holds critical information" for their investigation. Mandelson's cooperation—or resistance—will set a precedent for how international figures respond to American congressional subpoenas in cases with global reach.

**The DOJ's redaction policy** remains under fire from both sides. Bondi argues that releasing unredacted files would violate privacy laws and destroy innocent lives. Critics, including some in Trump's own coalition, argue that selective redaction protects the powerful while sacrificing transparency. Both positions have merit. Neither has a clear solution.

**Congress must reckon with its own role** in the chaos. Khanna's erroneous naming of four individuals with no documented Epstein ties demonstrates the risk. The pressure to "name names" and deliver accountability to an angry public can override the basic investigative standard of verifying information before going public. If lawmakers can't meet that standard, they have no business demanding it from DOJ.

**The media—including this site—must be more precise** in distinguishing between documented criminal conduct, suspicious patterns, and mere proximity. "Named in the Epstein files" can mean a hundred different things. Without context, it means nothing—or worse, it means everything.

Multiple questions remain unanswered: how many others were named incorrectly; which relationships documented in the files reflect criminal conduct versus professional networking versus social acquaintance; what information is still being withheld and on what basis.

Joe Rogan said this week that the Epstein files ["scare the hell out of me."](/articles/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-epstein-files-scare-the-hell-out-of-me)

The files document the difficulty of distinguishing guilt from proximity in a dataset of this scale, and the challenge of pursuing accountability without harming individuals who had no involvement in Epstein's crimes.

Until Congress, DOJ, and the public can agree on the difference, the Epstein files won't deliver accountability. They'll just deliver more names, more resignations, and more wreckage—some deserved, some not, all permanent.
