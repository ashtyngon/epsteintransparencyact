An attorney for Jeffrey Epstein survivors called billionaire Les Wexner's recent closed-door congressional testimony "abhorrent," while a survivor who voted for Donald Trump will attend his State of the Union address Tuesday as the guest of a Democratic lawmaker pushing for full document disclosure.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The developments come as members of Congress continue pressing for accountability following passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, with one Republican lawmaker accusing the president of using UFO announcements to distract from the ongoing document releases.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

**Haley Robson**, an Epstein survivor, will attend President Trump's State of the Union address as the guest of **Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.)**, the chief sponsor of legislation that forced House committees to release Epstein-related files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Robson voted for Trump in the 2024 election, according to The Independent.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Survivor's Attorney Condemns Wexner Testimony

Attorney **Spencer Kuvin**, who represents multiple Epstein survivors, called Wexner's recent deposition before the House Oversight Committee "abhorrent" during an appearance on The Hill, according to reporting by the outlet.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands, gave private testimony to lawmakers about his decades-long financial relationship with Epstein. The closed-door nature of the deposition has drawn criticism from advocates seeking full transparency.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Kuvin has represented survivors in civil litigation against Epstein's estate and other parties allegedly connected to the abuse network. He did not immediately provide additional details about his specific objections to Wexner's testimony, according to The Hill's report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Republican Accuses Trump of UFO Distraction

**Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)** accused President Trump of using UFO discussions as "the ultimate weapon of mass distraction" from ongoing releases of Epstein files, according to The Hill.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Massie made the statement as Trump has increased public discussion of unidentified aerial phenomena in recent weeks. The Kentucky congressman has been among the House Republicans calling for full disclosure of Epstein-related documents.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The timing of Massie's criticism coincides with continued document releases under the Epstein Transparency Act, which mandated declassification of certain government files related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates.

## Attorney: Government Was 'Original Blind Eye'

Attorney **Bradley Edwards** told NewsNation that the U.S. government was the "original blind eye" to Epstein's criminal conduct, referring to the 2008 non-prosecution agreement that allowed the financier to plead guilty to minor state charges in Florida.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Edwards, who has represented dozens of Epstein survivors in civil litigation, criticized federal prosecutors' handling of the original case. That 2008 deal, negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney **Alex Acosta**, allowed Epstein to serve just 13 months in county jail with work-release privileges despite a federal investigation that identified dozens of victims.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

"The government had all the evidence they needed to prosecute him properly the first time," Edwards told NewsNation.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Edwards did not provide new details about specific government failures beyond the widely documented 2008 plea agreement. A federal judge later ruled that prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by concealing the deal from victims before finalizing it.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Congressional Push Continues

Khanna's decision to bring Robson as his State of the Union guest represents the latest effort by congressional advocates to keep pressure on executive agencies to release documents. Khanna led the successful discharge petition that forced House committees to release files related to Epstein.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The California Democrat has not released a statement explaining why he selected Robson specifically as his guest for the high-profile address. House members traditionally use State of the Union guests to draw attention to policy priorities.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Robson's attendance comes as survivors and their advocates continue calling for accountability from individuals and institutions they say enabled Epstein's decades of abuse. Multiple civil cases remain pending against Epstein's estate and other defendants.<sup>[2](#ref-4)</sup>

The White House has not responded to Massie's accusation about UFO discussions serving as a distraction, according to The Hill's reporting.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>
