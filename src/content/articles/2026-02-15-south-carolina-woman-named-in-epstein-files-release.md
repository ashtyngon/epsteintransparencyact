A South Carolina woman appeared in correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein spanning multiple years, according to documents released by federal authorities and reviewed by the Post and Courier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The newspaper reported the woman's name appears in correspondence spanning several years but did not identify her publicly. The Post and Courier described her as having ties to South Carolina's Upstate region.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The documents do not detail the nature of the relationship or whether the woman traveled to any of Epstein's properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## South Carolina Connection

The disclosure adds South Carolina to states with documented Epstein contacts, a state not previously associated with his activities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Documents released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) show Epstein maintained contacts across multiple states, including [academics](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout), business executives, and public figures.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Being named in the documents does not indicate involvement in illegal activity.

## Ongoing Document Releases

The Department of Justice released thousands of pages in February. Attorney General Pam Bondi said DOJ had disclosed ["all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more) with full names listed.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Several members of Congress disputed that claim. Representative Nancy Mace accused DOJ of excluding names from the release.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Representative Thomas Massie said Bondi avoided eye contact with survivors during a congressional hearing on the files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## International Developments

The files have prompted resignations and investigations in multiple countries. France established a special review team to examine files for French nationals. UK police launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations.

Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned after being named in the files. Dubai's ports chief stepped down after hundreds of emails were made public.
