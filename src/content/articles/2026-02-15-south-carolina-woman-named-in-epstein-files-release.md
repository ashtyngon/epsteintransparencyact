A South Carolina woman maintained contact with Jeffrey Epstein over multiple years, according to documents released by federal authorities and reviewed by the Post and Courier.

The newspaper reported the woman's name appears in correspondence spanning several years but did not identify her publicly. The Post and Courier described her as having ties to South Carolina's Upstate region.

The documents do not detail what the relationship involved or whether the woman traveled to any of Epstein's properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.

## South Carolina Connection

The disclosure extends the geographic reach of Epstein's documented network into South Carolina, a state not previously associated with his activities. 

Documents released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) show Epstein maintained contacts across multiple states, including [academics](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout), business executives, and public figures. Some maintained legitimate professional relationships with him, while others face scrutiny over what they knew about his criminal conduct.

## Ongoing Document Releases

The Department of Justice released thousands of pages in February. Attorney General Pam Bondi said DOJ had disclosed ["all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more) with full names listed. 

Several members of Congress disputed that claim. Representative Nancy Mace accused DOJ of hiding names in the release. Representative Thomas Massie said Bondi avoided eye contact with survivors during a congressional hearing on the files.

## Global Fallout

The files have triggered resignations and investigations worldwide. France established a special review team to examine files for French nationals. UK police launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations.

Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned after being named in the files. Dubai's ports chief stepped down after hundreds of emails surfaced.
