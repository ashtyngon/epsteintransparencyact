**Attorney General Pam Bondi** released a six-page letter to Congress on **February 15, 2026**, listing more than 300 names associated with the Epstein files and declaring the Department of Justice had disclosed "all" documents required under the Epstein Transparency Act. The list included deceased celebrities **Marilyn Monroe** and **Janis Joplin**, prompting immediate accusations from lawmakers that the DOJ was deliberately obscuring names of individuals with actual connections to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal network.

**Rep. Thomas Massie** told reporters that Bondi appeared "afraid to" look at Epstein survivors who attended a congressional hearing on the file releases, according to statements he made on **February 15**. Massie, who has [previously lost confidence in Bondi over Epstein files](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash), accused the Attorney General of "purposefully mudding" the list by combining names of victims, witnesses, and people with no connection to Epstein's crimes alongside names of actual associates.

The DOJ letter follows weeks of escalating conflict between Bondi and members of Congress over the scope and completeness of file releases mandated by the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law in January.

## The 300-Name List

Bondi's six-page letter to Congress presented what she characterized as a comprehensive disclosure of names appearing in Epstein-related documents. The list included individuals across multiple categories: alleged perpetrators, witnesses, victims, law enforcement officials, and people whose names appeared in address books or flight logs without evidence of wrongdoing.

The inclusion of Monroe and Joplin—both of whom died decades before Epstein's sex trafficking operation became public—drew particular criticism. Monroe died in **1962**; Joplin in **1970**. Epstein was not convicted of his first sex crime until **2008**.

Lawmakers accused the DOJ of [deliberately "mudding" the names](/news/2026-02-15-lawmakers-accuse-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-names-in-doj-letter) by failing to distinguish between individuals with documented connections to Epstein's crimes and those whose names appeared in files for unrelated reasons. **Rep. Nancy Mace** said the DOJ was ["hiding names"](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) through this approach.

The letter stated the DOJ had released "all" documents related to required disclosures under the Transparency Act. Bondi defended this characterization in public statements, saying her office had provided full names rather than redacted versions.

## Congressional Confrontation

Massie's comments about Bondi's behavior at the hearing reflect deepening tensions between the Attorney General and lawmakers investigating Epstein's network. According to The Hill, Massie described Bondi as unwilling to make eye contact with survivors present at the session.

The hearing occurred amid ongoing disputes over redactions in previously released files. Massie ripped the Trump DOJ over redactions that obscured names of high-profile individuals. He declared "I am not suicidal" on **February 14**, a statement widely interpreted as concern for his safety while pursuing transparency.

Other lawmakers have pressed Bondi on specific names. One congressman publicly named six men whose identities remained hidden in released files despite the Transparency Act's requirements. **Rep. Ro Khanna** said Epstein's elite network "knew enough to know better" about the crimes occurring.

The FBI previously explained its rationale for redactions, citing ongoing investigations and witness protection concerns. One expert warned that raw file releases could compromise active criminal inquiries. But these explanations have not satisfied congressional critics who point to the Trump administration's call to end the Epstein investigation as evidence of obstruction.

## Global Fallout Continues

The Epstein files have triggered resignations and new investigations globally, creating a contrast between international accountability and what critics describe as protection for U.S. elites. The files have toppled European officials while American counterparts retain power, according to recent analysis.

**France** established a special team to review files for French nationals. French prosecutors are investigating a diplomat whose name appeared in released documents. **UK police** launched a national task force for trafficking allegations, with the UK's top prosecutor stating "nobody is above the law" as authorities examine Prince Andrew's connections.

Prince Andrew faces renewed scrutiny after documents showed his aide advised Epstein to hide his conviction on a visa form. New emails contradict claims Andrew made in his BBC interview about the extent of his relationship with Epstein.

In the U.S., **Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's** Epstein connections have become a GOP liability, with Republican senators viewing his documented contacts as a political problem.

## Public Access and Technical Workarounds

As the DOJ faces accusations of deliberately complicating file access, independent efforts have emerged to make released materials more navigable. A new platform called **JeffTube**—described as a YouTube clone—now hosts video files from DOJ releases in a searchable format, according to The Sunday Guardian.

The platform represents a response to complaints that the DOJ's release format makes systematic review difficult. The **New York Times** launched a major investigation involving analysis of millions of pages. Epstein emails have spread virally across social media as individuals and organizations conduct independent reviews.

The FBI began its formal review of records under the Transparency Act in January. Courts have also released new batches of documents separate from the DOJ's mandated disclosures, adding to the volume of material now public.

## Named Individuals and Institutional Responses

The files have exposed connections across multiple sectors. College presidents and professors appeared in documents. **Joel Klein**, former NYC schools chancellor, met with Epstein in 2013, according to released records. Documents showed Epstein pulled strings at the University of Alabama.

**Goldman Sachs's top lawyer resigned** after being named in the files. A **Dubai ports chief** quit after hundreds of secret emails were exposed. An ex-Clifford Chance lawyer's hidden ties emerged from email records.

In media, **Piers Morgan** was named 29 times in files. **Media mogul Michael Ferro** canceled a last-minute meeting with Epstein, according to emails. **Joe Rogan** said the files "scare the hell out of me" during his podcast.

Financial figures faced consequences. **Leon Black**, named in documents, saw schools cancel photo day events. **Casey Wasserman** sold his agency and exited his Olympic role after Maxwell emails surfaced. **Orioles owner David Rubenstein** was named in files.

International figures include an Indian businessman, minister and guru. **Nobel committee chief Thorbjørn Jagland** received gifts from Epstein, emails showed. Documents indicated Epstein used Nobel Prize access to lure elites.

Political connections extended to fundraising. Files showed consultants pitched Epstein access to NY Democrats for donations. Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner, Epstein's longtime associate. One senator blocked Epstein files after receiving a mysterious donation.

**Steve Bannon** was recorded in files as having discussed "taking down" Pope Francis with Epstein, according to DOJ documents. **Trump insider Tom Barrack** was named in files. A Texas GOP comptroller candidate faced party alarm over purchasing Epstein's ranch.

## Financial Institutions and Ongoing Litigation

**Bank of America** faces continued legal exposure after a court allowed an Epstein trafficking lawsuit to proceed. The decision permits discovery into the bank's role in facilitating financial transactions for Epstein's operation.

The FBI holds thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's secret island operation, according to reports. Congressional subpoenas have been issued for Peter Mandelson and Les Wexner, the Limited Brands founder who had extensive financial entanglements with Epstein.

**Ghislaine Maxwell**, currently serving a 20-year sentence, offered to reveal "truth" in exchange for clemency. No decision on that request has been announced.

## Survivor Accounts and Systemic Failures

**Juliette Bryant**, an Epstein survivor, told investigators she "thought I was going to die" during her time in Epstein's trafficking network. Her account joins testimony from other survivors who have spoken publicly about their experiences.

The New York Times investigation revealed how elite immunity protected Epstein across decades. Analysis shows the case exposes cracks in America's rule of law system, with wealthy defendants receiving preferential treatment unavailable to typical criminal defendants.

Newly released video from Epstein's office appeared in the latest document dump, though details of the footage content remain limited in public reports.

## Political Tensions Within Republican Party

Internal GOP tensions have emerged over the handling of disclosures. **Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** blasted Trump's handling of the files as a "political miscalculation." Her criticism came despite her general alignment with Trump on other issues.

The administration faces accusations of a cover-up over file redactions. Allegations surfaced that AG Bondi was caught spying on Democrats' searches of Epstein files, though details of that monitoring have not been fully disclosed.

During testimony, Bondi was grilled on why the AG resists full document release. Her explanations cited law enforcement sensitivity and victim privacy, but critics point to the inclusion of dead celebrities in the name list as evidence those justifications lack credibility.

Congressional hearings on the Transparency Act's implementation continue. The DOJ's assertion that
