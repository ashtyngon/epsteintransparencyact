French authorities opened two criminal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein's activities on February 18, 2026, Reuters reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The probes focus on human trafficking and tax fraud connected to the late financier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Paris prosecutor's office [announced the investigations](https://epsteintransparencyact.com/news/2026-02-18-paris-prosecutors-open-2-epstein-probes-urge-french-victims-to-testify) the same day and called on French victims to provide testimony about Epstein-related crimes.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Prosecutors did not specify what triggered the opening of the investigations or name potential witnesses.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The human trafficking investigation will examine allegations of trafficking and related crimes. The tax fraud probe represents a separate inquiry into potential financial misconduct.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Recent French Law Enforcement Activity

The February 18 announcement followed days of French activity related to Epstein. Paris police raided the Arab World Institute on February 16 as part of an Epstein investigation.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

French prosecutors previously investigated a diplomat in connection with Epstein on February 15.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> On February 14, France established a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on sex trafficking charges and is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.

## International Investigations

The French probes add to [growing law enforcement scrutiny across Europe](https://epsteintransparencyact.com/news/2026-02-18-epstein-files-revelations-spark-new-european-police-probes). UK police assessed trafficking claims at Stansted Airport in February, reviewing allegations that Epstein's network used British airports.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

UK authorities also announced in February that "nobody is above the law" while probing Prince Andrew over allegations in the Epstein files.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> British police launched a national task force for Epstein trafficking allegations on February 14.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>

A United Nations panel stated February 18 that Epstein files may reveal crimes against humanity.<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>

## U.S. Document Release

In the United States, the FBI began reviewing Epstein-related records under the Epstein Client List and Financial Disclosure Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2026.<sup>[10](#ref-10)</sup>

The Justice Department released documents in February that named approximately 300 individuals in Epstein's network. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the release as complete, though lawmakers including Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Nancy Mace accused the DOJ of excessive redactions.<sup>[11](#ref-11)</sup>

The French investigations represent some of the most specific criminal probes announced outside the United States since the February document releases intensified international scrutiny of Epstein's network.
