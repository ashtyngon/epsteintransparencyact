A recent opinion piece in the Chronicle of Philanthropy examines Jeffrey Epstein's relationships with academic institutions as a case study in donor screening failures.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The article, published February 23, 2026, focuses on how Epstein cultivated ties with researchers and universities, using the case to illustrate vulnerabilities in standard fundraising practices at educational institutions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Epstein's Academic Network

Epstein funded scientific research and academic programs at multiple prestigious institutions before his 2008 guilty plea to soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida state court. He was arrested again in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges and died in federal custody the following month.

His philanthropic activities included substantial donations to [Harvard University and MIT](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> MIT accepted at least $800,000 from Epstein, according to the university's internal investigation released in January 2020. That review found Epstein visited campus and met with researchers even after his 2008 conviction, with some visits facilitated by Media Lab director Joi Ito, who resigned in September 2019 after the extent of his Epstein ties became public.

Harvard faced similar scrutiny over its relationship with Epstein, who maintained an office at the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, a university-affiliated research center, through 2018. The university's 2020 review documented that Epstein donated $6.5 million to Harvard between 1998 and 2007, primarily to the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and the Department of Psychology.

## University Vetting Failures

Multiple universities continued accepting Epstein's donations and granting him campus access years after his 2008 conviction became public record. This pattern revealed significant gaps in institutional due diligence procedures for evaluating donors.

Following media investigations into Epstein's academic ties in 2019, universities faced criticism from students, faculty, and the public. MIT President L. Rafael Reif apologized in a campus-wide letter, acknowledging the institution's failures. Harvard President Lawrence Bacow announced the university would donate all unspent Epstein funds to organizations supporting trafficking victims.

## Policy Reforms

The Chronicle's commentary highlights how academic institutions have since revised their approach to major gifts.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Development offices at major universities now conduct more extensive background checks on potential donors, particularly for contributions exceeding certain thresholds.

Many institutions established or strengthened gift acceptance committees that review donations from individuals with criminal records, adverse media coverage, or potential conflicts of interest. These committees typically include representatives from development, legal, and academic leadership who evaluate whether accepting a gift could compromise institutional integrity.

The reforms reflect a broader shift in higher education fundraising, where reputational risk assessment has become a standard component of donor vetting. Universities now routinely conduct criminal background checks, media searches, and litigation reviews before accepting significant contributions.

Some institutions also adopted retrospective review policies, requiring periodic reassessment of major donors' standing even after initial gifts are accepted. This addresses cases like Epstein's, where criminal conduct or reputational issues emerge after a donor relationship begins.

## Ongoing Impact

The Epstein case continues to shape fundraising practices across higher education. Universities must balance their need for philanthropic support with increased scrutiny from stakeholders who demand ethical standards in donor relationships.

The Chronicle article emphasizes that while philanthropic funding remains crucial for academic research and programs, institutions need clear policies for screening donors and mechanisms for declining gifts that could damage their missions or reputations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
