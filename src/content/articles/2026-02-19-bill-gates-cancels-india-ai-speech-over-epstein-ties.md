Bill Gates withdrew from a scheduled keynote address at India's AI Impact Summit on Thursday, citing a need to keep focus on the event's priorities amid ongoing scrutiny of his past association with Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The cancellation marked the latest instance in which the Microsoft co-founder's documented history of meetings with the convicted sex offender has affected his public engagements.

## India AI Summit Cancellation

Gates had been scheduled to deliver a keynote address at the AI Impact Summit, a high-profile technology conference in India that drew leaders from across the global artificial intelligence sector.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Microsoft co-founder's decision to pull out came after what event organizers described as "careful consideration."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"After careful consideration and to ensure the focus remained on the AI Summit's key priorities, Mr. Gates did not deliver the keynote address at the AI Summit," according to a statement about the cancellation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The statement framed the decision as intended to prevent Epstein-related controversy from overshadowing the conference's artificial intelligence agenda.

The decision to withdraw from such a prominent speaking engagement represented a significant schedule change for Gates, who regularly delivers keynote addresses at major technology and policy conferences worldwide. The India AI Impact Summit would have provided a platform to discuss artificial intelligence development and policy in one of the world's fastest-growing technology markets.

India's technology sector has increasingly positioned itself as a major player in AI development and governance. The summit was designed to showcase that ambition, and Gates's participation would have been among its headline events. His absence left organizers to restructure the conference program on short notice.

## Gates's Previous Epstein Ties

Gates's withdrawal from the India summit follows years of reporting about his meetings with Epstein. According to reporting by The New York Times and other outlets, Gates met with Epstein at least six times between 2011 and 2014, well after Epstein's 2008 conviction on state prostitution charges in Florida.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The meetings included visits to Epstein's Manhattan townhouse and discussions that Gates described as related to philanthropy.

The timing of those meetings has been a persistent source of criticism directed at Gates. In a 2023 interview with PBS News, Gates called the meetings "a huge mistake" and said he regretted any association with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein connection also had personal consequences for Gates. The New York Times reported that Melinda French Gates cited her then-husband's meetings with Epstein as one factor in the couple's 2021 divorce, which ended their 27-year marriage. French Gates later confirmed in interviews that she was disturbed by Gates's association with Epstein and that it played a role in her decision to seek a divorce.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Gates has consistently denied knowledge of any criminal behavior by Epstein during their interactions. He has said the meetings were focused on global health and philanthropic fundraising and that he did not have a personal friendship with the financier beyond those discussions.

## Continued Reputational Fallout

The India summit cancellation illustrates the continuing reputational consequences for prominent figures linked to Epstein, even years after his death in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019. Gates is among the most high-profile individuals whose professional and public activities have been affected by past Epstein associations.

No criminal charges or civil litigation involving Gates have been reported in connection with Epstein. The consequences have been reputational and professional in nature, affecting Gates's ability to serve as a public figure at events where organizers and audiences may view his presence as a distraction from the stated agenda.

The cancellation comes amid a broader period of renewed scrutiny of Epstein's network following congressional hearings and the release of court documents in recent months. Gates's decision to step back from the India event suggests that the Epstein association remains a significant factor in how his public appearances are managed and perceived.
