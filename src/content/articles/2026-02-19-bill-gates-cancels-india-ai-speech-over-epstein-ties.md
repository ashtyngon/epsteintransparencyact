Bill Gates withdrew from a scheduled keynote address at India's AI Impact Summit on Thursday, citing a need to keep focus on the event's priorities amid ongoing scrutiny of his past association with Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The cancellation came as another high-profile figure, billionaire Les Wexner, faced skepticism from lawmakers about his congressional testimony regarding his ties to Epstein, and as a consulting firm co-founded by Peter Mandelson announced it would enter administration after losing major clients following Epstein-related revelations.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The convergence of these three separate developments on the same day demonstrated continued fallout for prominent business and political figures linked to Epstein. Each case involved different circumstances but shared a common thread: reputational consequences stemming from documented or alleged connections to the convicted sex offender.

Gates had been scheduled to deliver a keynote address at the AI Impact Summit, a high-profile technology conference in India.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Microsoft co-founder's decision to pull out came after what the event organizers described as "careful consideration."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Scrutiny of Wexner Testimony

Rep. Yassamin Ansari, a Democrat from Arizona and member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, questioned the credibility of Les Wexner's testimony before the committee on Wednesday.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Wexner, the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands, appeared before lawmakers to discuss his relationship with Epstein, who managed his finances for years.

"Very hard to believe," Ansari said of Wexner's testimony during an appearance on CNN's "The Source" with host Kaitlan Collins.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The Arizona congresswoman told Collins that she "went into the deposition with" skepticism about Wexner's account.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Wexner has previously stated publicly that he was "duped" by Epstein, who had extensive access to his financial affairs and personal life during their business relationship.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The nature of Ansari's specific concerns about Wexner's testimony was not detailed in available reports.

The House Oversight Committee's investigation into Epstein-related matters has involved testimony from multiple individuals connected to the financier. Wexner's business relationship with Epstein spanned decades before Wexner severed ties in 2007.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Advisory Firm Collapse Linked to Mandelson

Global Counsel, a London-based advisory firm co-founded by Peter Mandelson, announced Thursday it would enter administration, directly attributing the collapse to what it called a "maelstrom" caused by revelations about Mandelson's relationship with Epstein.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Mandelson is a former British Labour politician and peer who served as European Commissioner for Trade.

The firm lost a string of major clients including Barclays, Tesco, and the Premier League.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> These departures came despite Global Counsel's attempts to sever ties with both Mandelson and co-founder Benjamin Wegg-Prosser.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The specific nature of the revelations about Mandelson's relationship with Epstein that prompted the client exodus was not detailed in available reports. The firm's statement explicitly linked the administration decision to the Epstein-related controversy rather than other business factors.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Global Counsel's collapse represents one of the most significant corporate casualties directly attributed to Epstein associations. The loss of clients from major British institutions including a leading bank, a retail giant, and the country's top football league demonstrated the scope of reputational concerns among corporations seeking to distance themselves from any Epstein connections.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The firm's decision to call in administrators came after its attempts at damage control through leadership separation proved insufficient to retain its client base. Administration in British corporate law typically involves an insolvency practitioner taking control of a company to either rescue it as a going concern or achieve a better result for creditors than immediate liquidation would provide.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Gates's Previous Epstein Ties

Gates's withdrawal from the India summit follows years of reporting about his meetings with Epstein. The Microsoft co-founder has previously acknowledged meeting with Epstein multiple times, primarily in connection with philanthropic fundraising efforts, but has stated he regretted those interactions.

"After careful consideration and to ensure the focus remained on the AI Summit's key priorities, Mr. Gates did not deliver the keynote address at the AI Summit," according to a statement about the cancellation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The statement framed the decision as intended to prevent Epstein-related controversy from overshadowing the conference's artificial intelligence agenda.

Gates's meetings with Epstein occurred years after Epstein's 2008 conviction on state prostitution charges in Florida. The timing of those meetings has been a source of criticism directed at Gates.

The decision to withdraw from such a prominent speaking engagement represented a significant schedule change for Gates, who regularly delivers keynote addresses at major technology and policy conferences worldwide. The India AI Impact Summit would have provided a platform to discuss artificial intelligence development and policy in one of the world's fastest-growing technology markets.

## Pattern of Business and Institutional Responses

The three developments on Thursday illustrated different mechanisms through which Epstein associations continue to affect prominent individuals and organizations. Gates chose to preemptively withdraw from a public appearance, Wexner faced direct congressional questioning about his account of events, and Mandelson's business venture collapsed after corporate clients severed relationships.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Corporate and institutional responses have varied based on the nature and timing of Epstein connections, the prominence of the individuals involved, and the specific business or political contexts. Gates's case involved voluntary withdrawal from an event, while Global Counsel experienced client-driven business failure, and Wexner faced government oversight through congressional testimony.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Each situation involved different legal and reputational questions. No criminal charges or civil litigation were reported in connection with any of these three specific developments on Thursday. The consequences described were reputational and business-related rather than legal in nature.
