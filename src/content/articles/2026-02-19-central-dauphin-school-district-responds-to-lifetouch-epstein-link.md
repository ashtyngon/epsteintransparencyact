A Pennsylvania school district has issued a statement after **Lifetouch**, the company that provides its student photography services, was named in recently released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The development comes as multiple entities and individuals connected to Epstein face renewed scrutiny following document disclosures.

**Central Dauphin School District** confirmed it contracts with Lifetouch for student photography services.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The district issued a response after the company's name surfaced in Epstein-related documents, though the specific nature of Lifetouch's appearance in those documents was not detailed in available reports.

The district's statement follows a pattern of organizations distancing themselves from entities linked to Epstein as document releases continue. According to previous reporting, multiple school districts have severed contracts with Lifetouch after revelations about connections between the photography company and individuals named in Epstein files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Wexner Denies Knowledge of Criminal Activity

Billionaire **Leslie Wexner**, founder of L Brands and former owner of Victoria's Secret, testified that he was "duped" by Jeffrey Epstein and had no knowledge of the financier's criminal conduct.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Wexner made the statements during testimony related to ongoing investigations into Epstein's activities.

"I was unaware of Epstein's criminal conduct," Wexner said according to testimony reported by The Independent.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The billionaire has previously acknowledged a close financial relationship with Epstein, who managed his wealth and held power of attorney over his financial affairs.

Wexner's testimony comes amid questions about how Epstein accumulated influence within elite business and social circles. The billionaire severed his professional relationship with Epstein in 2007, though the exact circumstances and timing of that separation have been subjects of inquiry.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Campbell Addresses Epstein Connection

Supermodel **Naomi Campbell** has denied involvement with Jeffrey Epstein's illegal activities while acknowledging social connections to the financier.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> According to Black Enterprise, Campbell "stayed in Epstein's orbit" but denies ties to his criminal conduct.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Campbell's name has appeared in flight logs and other documents showing she traveled in Epstein's social circles. The supermodel has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein's activities.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Flight logs previously released showed Campbell traveled on Epstein's private aircraft, though the specific dates and destinations varied. The model joins dozens of public figures who have had to address their connections to Epstein following his 2019 arrest and subsequent death.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Pattern of Institutional Response

The Central Dauphin School District response represents a microcosm of how institutions are handling revelations about connections to Epstein-linked entities. Organizations from school districts to corporate boards have issued statements or taken action when documents revealed previously unknown connections.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Lifetouch operates as one of the largest student photography companies in North America, providing yearbook photos and school portraits to thousands of districts. The company's appearance in Epstein-related documents has prompted inquiries from multiple school districts about the nature and extent of any connections.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Central Dauphin School District serves approximately 11,000 students across 18 schools in Pennsylvania's Cumberland and Dauphin counties. District officials did not specify in available statements whether they plan to continue or terminate their contract with Lifetouch.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Document Releases Continue

The statements from Wexner, Campbell, and institutional responses like Central Dauphin's come as document releases related to Epstein continue. Court-ordered unsealing of documents from civil litigation has revealed names, flight logs, and other records detailing Epstein's extensive network of business and social connections.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Many individuals named in documents have issued denials of knowledge about or participation in illegal activities. Others, like Wexner, have characterized themselves as victims of Epstein's deception rather than willing participants in or enablers of his criminal enterprise.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The documents stem from multiple sources including civil litigation brought by Epstein victims, criminal investigations, and court proceedings related to the conviction of **Ghislaine Maxwell**, Epstein's longtime associate. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges related to sex trafficking of minors.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Scope of Epstein Network

The breadth of names appearing in documents has illustrated the extensive reach of Epstein's social and business networks. Connections span business titans like Wexner, entertainment and fashion figures like Campbell, and corporations like Lifetouch that appear in financial or business records.<sup>[1](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Epstein maintained residences in New York, Florida, New Mexico, Paris, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. He traveled extensively via private aircraft and maintained what prosecutors described as an organized criminal enterprise dedicated to trafficking underage girls.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Federal prosecutors charged Epstein in July 2019 with sex trafficking of minors. He died in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>
