Ian Maxwell, brother of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, has publicly criticized the British royal family following [Prince Andrew's arrest](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-in-london-over-epstein-documents) on charges related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, according to Inquisitr News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Maxwell told reporters that Prince Andrew "doesn't even" deserve the treatment he has received, according to Inquisitr News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The incomplete quote suggests Maxwell was making a broader statement about the Duke of York's treatment by authorities or the royal family itself.

## Maxwell Family Connection to Prince Andrew

Ghislaine Maxwell maintained a longtime friendship with Prince Andrew that spanned decades.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for sex trafficking and conspiracy charges related to her work with Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Prince Andrew was arrested in London on document-sharing charges related to the Epstein investigation. UK authorities have expanded their investigation into the Duke of York's ties to Epstein, including questioning his protection officers about his activities.

Ian Maxwell's public defense of Prince Andrew marks a rare comment from the Maxwell family since Ghislaine's conviction. The family has largely avoided public statements about the Epstein case and its impact on prominent figures who associated with the convicted sex offender.

## Ongoing Investigations

Prince Andrew's arrest represents an escalation in accountability for Epstein associates. UK police have launched multiple probes into the Duke's relationship with Epstein, including investigations into whether trafficking occurred on British soil.

The arrest has drawn international attention to how different governments are handling investigations into Epstein's network of powerful associates. Multiple countries have opened probes into individuals named in recently released documents related to the Epstein case.

Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on five counts related to recruiting and grooming underage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022 and is currently incarcerated at a federal facility in Florida.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Maxwell family's connection to Prince Andrew dates back decades and has been documented through photographs and public appearances. Ian Maxwell's criticism of the royal family's handling of Prince Andrew's case marks the first public comment from a Maxwell family member defending someone implicated in the Epstein scandal.

UK authorities continue to investigate Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein and whether he violated British law. The Duke has denied wrongdoing but faces mounting legal pressure as investigators review newly released documents from U.S. law enforcement files.
