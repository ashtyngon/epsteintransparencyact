Tom Pritzker stepped down as chairman of Hyatt Hotels Corporation after his name surfaced in Epstein files released by the Department of Justice. The 75-year-old billionaire heir becomes at least the seventh major executive to resign since the document release.

[Previous reporting](/news/2026-02-16-hyatt-heir-tom-pritzker-steps-down-over-epstein-contact-links) documented Pritzker's departure from the hotel chain founded by his family. The Pritzker family built Hyatt into one of America's largest hotel empires, operating more than 1,000 properties worldwide.

## Finance and Sports Executives Exit

Goldman Sachs' general counsel resigned after being named in files released in mid-February. [Casey Wasserman sold his sports agency](/news/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-agency-after-epstein-files-expose-ties) and [stepped down as Olympic chief](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) after emails revealed extensive communications with Ghislaine Maxwell.

The chief executive of Dubai Ports World left his position after hundreds of secret emails with Epstein came to light. An ex-Clifford Chance lawyer's hidden ties were exposed in the document release.

## European Figures Face Scrutiny

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, shut down six companies after her Epstein ties were documented in the files.

Prince Andrew faces new pressure as emails contradicted his public statements made during a 2019 BBC interview. UK authorities created a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations connected to the files.

France established a special team to review files for French nationals. French prosecutors opened an investigation into a diplomat whose name appeared in the documents.

## Academic and Media Departures

College presidents and professors stepped down after being named. Columbia University removed staff members who facilitated admission for an Epstein-linked applicant to the dental school.

Media mogul Michael Ferro appeared in files showing he canceled a last-minute meeting with Epstein. Documents showed Epstein received invitations to congressional galas years after his 2008 conviction.

## Lawmakers Demand Full Transparency

Rep. Nancy Mace and Rep. Ro Khanna have pushed for complete document releases. An analysis found the DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files in its initial response to the transparency law.

Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the release as complete, while lawmakers accused her of "mudding" the list by including deceased celebrities.

Rep. Thomas Massie said Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors during congressional testimony and later declared "I am not suicidal" as pressure mounted over his push for transparency.

## International Probes Expand

New Mexico launched its first full investigation into Epstein's Zorro Ranch, the property where abuse allegations occurred. The FBI holds thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's island operation connected to the case.

UN human rights experts called for investigations and warned of potential crimes against humanity. Global investigations into Epstein's international network continue to expand.
