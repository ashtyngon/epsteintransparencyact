Casey Wasserman, 51, will sell his namesake sports and entertainment agency, according to reports emerging after the release of Epstein-related documents.

The sale follows Wasserman's [resignation from his role as chairman of the LA 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games organizing committee](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) last week. That departure came after documents showed email correspondence between Wasserman and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted on December 29, 2021 of sex trafficking minors and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

Wasserman Media Group represents athletes, musicians, and brands across multiple sports and entertainment sectors.

## Part of wider fallout

The sale is the latest in a series of exits tied to documents released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law). 

[Kathryn Ruemmler, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the files. [Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, chair of Dubai's DP World, stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after appearing more than 4,700 times in the documents.

Congress has opened investigations into multiple individuals named in the files, issuing subpoenas to [billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and [British politician Peter Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe).

Wasserman has not publicly addressed the timing of the sale or its connection to the document release.
