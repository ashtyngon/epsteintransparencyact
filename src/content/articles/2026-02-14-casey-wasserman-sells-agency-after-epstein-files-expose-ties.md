Casey Wasserman will sell his namesake sports and entertainment agency, according to reports emerging after the release of Epstein-related documents.

The sale follows Wasserman's [resignation from his role leading the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games organizing committee](/articles/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) last week. That departure came after documents showed email correspondence between Wasserman and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Wasserman Media Group represents athletes, musicians, and brands across multiple sports and entertainment sectors.

## Part of wider fallout

The sale is the latest in a series of exits tied to documents released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law). 

[Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the files. The [chair of Dubai's DP World stepped down](/articles/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails surfaced.

Congress has opened investigations into multiple individuals named in the files, issuing subpoenas to [billionaire Les Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and [British politician Peter Mandelson](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe).

Wasserman has not publicly addressed the timing of the sale or its connection to the document release.
