Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chair and CEO of DP World, resigned early Friday after the Justice Department's release of Epstein files named him in documents detailing ties to the convicted sex offender. The resignation took effect immediately.

The Dubai-based supply chain giant confirmed the departure but disclosed nothing about what the documents revealed or the nature of Sulayem's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

## Pattern of Executive Fallout

Sulayem's exit follows a string of high-profile resignations since the DOJ began releasing Epstein files. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-secret-epstein-ties-revealed-in-emails) after emails surfaced showing undisclosed contact with Epstein. [Another billionaire CEO resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-billionaire-ceo-resigns-after-epstein-connection-exposed) days earlier under similar pressure.

The corporate response is fast and decisive: executives appear in the files, executives resign. What remains unclear is what these men were hiding and why they concealed their Epstein connections until forced into the open.

## What DP World Won't Say

DP World's statement offered no explanation—no timeline of when Sulayem knew Epstein, no disclosure of meetings or communications, no clarification of whether business dealings occurred. Just confirmation of his departure.

That silence is a choice. Sulayem led a company managing global logistics infrastructure. His undisclosed relationship with a convicted sex trafficker raises obvious questions that neither he nor DP World has answered.

## Contrast With Protected Figures

The swift fall of corporate executives stands in sharp relief against the protected status of other powerful men named in the files. [Billionaire Leslie Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-reveals-6-named-in-epstein-files-labels-wexner-co-conspirator), publicly labeled a "co-conspirator" by a congressman on the House floor, has said nothing. [Orioles owner David Rubenstein](/articles/2026-02-12-orioles-owner-david-rubenstein-named-in-epstein-files) was named in documents but faces no apparent consequences.

Congressional Democrats, led by Rep. Ro Khanna, are [demanding full release](/articles/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down) of all names. Attorney General Pam Bondi continues [resisting](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) calls to release unredacted files.

The documents clearly contain information damaging enough to end careers. The question is who else appears in the blacked-out sections—and why the DOJ is protecting them.
