Craven County Schools issued a statement after an immunization record from one of its middle schools appeared in the Justice Department's Epstein files release, according to WITN.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The North Carolina district confirmed the document originated from a Craven County middle school. The statement came after WITN reported the record's presence in the files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The district did not disclose which school, which student, or what its statement said beyond acknowledging the document.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Protected Records

School immunization records typically contain a student's name, date of birth, vaccination history, and parent contact information. Federal law restricts disclosure of student records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which prohibits schools from releasing information without parental consent except in specific circumstances.

The record is among millions of pages released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law). The DOJ has disclosed emails, flight logs, and financial records spanning decades.

## Congressional Pressure Continues

The document surfaced as lawmakers press Attorney General Bondi over the file release. Rep. Thomas Massie and other members of Congress have [criticized the DOJ](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) over the extent of redactions in released files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The New York Times has [assigned reporters to investigate](/news/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) the released documents.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> France and the United Kingdom established specialized teams to review files for their nationals.
