Detectives investigating Prince Andrew's ties to Jeffrey Epstein are urging the former royal's police protection officers to come forward with information about what they witnessed during their years of duty, according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The call for testimony from Andrew's security detail represents what The Guardian described as a shift in the ongoing investigation over the weekend.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The investigation has primarily focused on testimony from women who were trafficked by Epstein and allegations that Andrew passed sensitive information to the convicted sex offender while serving as the UK's trade envoy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Law enforcement officials want protection officers who guarded Andrew during his tenure as a senior royal to share observations and information gathered while accompanying him on official duties, The Guardian reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The request comes amid what the outlet described as "fresh scrutiny" of Andrew's relationship with Epstein, including claims related to security arrangements at Epstein's New York residence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Investigation Encompasses Multiple Allegations

The development marks a new phase in the investigation, which had previously concentrated on interviewing victims and examining Andrew's role as UK trade envoy. The Guardian reported that detectives are now asking protection officers to come forward and speak about what they saw and heard while on duty.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The investigation encompasses multiple aspects of Andrew's association with Epstein, including alleged information sharing while Andrew served in his official government capacity as trade envoy, according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The request for protection officer testimony follows earlier reporting on Andrew's use of taxpayer funds while serving as trade envoy. [Documents revealed Andrew charged British taxpayers for massage services during official trips](/news/2026-02-23-prince-andrew-charged-taxpayers-for-massages-as-trade-envoy-guardian), The Guardian previously reported, raising questions about his expense claims during the period when he maintained contact with Epstein after the financier's 2008 conviction.

Protection officers assigned to senior members of the British royal family maintain close proximity to their subjects during both public and private engagements. The Guardian reported that investigators are seeking information about what these officers witnessed while guarding Andrew.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Background on Epstein Case

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse.

Andrew, who now uses the surname Mountbatten-Windsor after being stripped of his royal titles and military affiliations, has faced ongoing scrutiny over his friendship with Epstein. He settled a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre in 2022, who alleged she was trafficked to Andrew by Epstein when she was 17. Andrew has consistently denied the allegations.

The current police investigation examining whether Andrew shared sensitive government information during his time as trade envoy represents a separate line of inquiry from the civil settlement. The Guardian's report indicates investigators are seeking information about Andrew's activities across multiple jurisdictions, including security protocols at Epstein's properties.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Guardian reported that the investigation now includes claims about security arrangements at Epstein's New York home, though the outlet did not specify the nature of those claims.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
