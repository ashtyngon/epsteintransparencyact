**Rep. Ro Khanna** delivered a blunt message Sunday: "stop protecting predators." The California Democrat joined a growing chorus of lawmakers demanding answers about heavy redactions in the Justice Department's release of Jeffrey Epstein files, as former Secretary of State **Hillary Clinton** accused the Trump administration of a "cover-up" in a BBC interview aired Monday.

The DOJ sent a letter to Congress on Saturday listing names of "politically exposed persons" mentioned in Epstein's files, according to PBS NewsHour. The move came after weeks of criticism over [extensive redactions](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) that left [only 2% of the files fully visible](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows), according to a recent analysis.

"Get the files out. They are slow-walking it," Clinton told the BBC in an interview published Monday. The White House responded that it has done "more for the victims than Democrats ever did."

## Political Fallout Intensifies

The clash marks a sharp escalation in the controversy over the Epstein file release, which has already triggered [resignations across multiple continents](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-files-trigger-global-resignations-new-investigations) and Congressional hearings where Attorney General Pam Bondi faced hostile questioning.

Khanna's comments on PBS NewsHour followed his earlier demands for full transparency after multiple high-profile executives stepped down when their Epstein connections emerged in the documents. The congressman has been among the most vocal critics of the DOJ's handling of the files.

The Justice Department's Saturday letter represents the first official acknowledgment of specific categories of individuals mentioned in the files since the initial release. However, lawmakers including Rep. Nancy Mace have accused the DOJ of "mudding" the list by including dead celebrities alongside those with more significant connections.

## Congressional Oversight Expands

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Minnesota and Iowa are determining whether to review unredacted versions of the files, according to KTTC Rochester. Members of Congress have access to unredacted documents through secure facilities, though many have not yet exercised that right.

The controversy has created unusual political dynamics. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized Trump's handling of the files as a "political miscalculation", while Rep. Thomas Massie declared "I am not suicidal" and said Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors during a recent hearing.

Clinton's accusation represents the highest-profile Democratic attack on the Trump administration's file release. Her statement to the BBC comes as France established a special team to review files for French nationals and UK police launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations.

## Files Reveal Widespread Connections

The released documents continue to expose connections across business, politics, and academia. Recent revelations include **Sarah Ferguson**, former wife of Prince Andrew, whose messages to Epstein after his conviction prompted the closure of six companies linked to her, according to Companies House records reviewed by The Guardian.

The companies filed strike-off applications after details of Ferguson's contact with Epstein emerged in the document release last month. The Guardian reported the filings came directly after new information about her relationship with the convicted sex offender came to light.

Local searches of the files are producing unexpected results. A search for "Staten Island" in the Epstein files generated hundreds of hits related to underwear, attorneys, and autopsy records, according to SILive.com. The searches demonstrate the massive scope of the document release and the difficulty in parsing its contents.

**Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's** Epstein contacts have become a GOP liability, according to reports from multiple Republican senators. The administration has defended Lutnick's confirmation despite his name appearing in released files.

## International Investigations Multiply

The file release continues to generate investigations beyond U.S. borders. French prosecutors opened an investigation into a diplomat mentioned in the documents. India named a businessman, minister, and guru in its review of the files.

UN experts called for investigation into the files and warned of potential crimes against humanity. The UK's top prosecutor stated "nobody is above the law" as police opened a probe into Prince Andrew's connections.

The documents have also exposed institutional failures. Columbia University removed staff who facilitated an Epstein-linked dental school admission. Documents showed Epstein was invited to Congressional galas years after his arrest.

## Technology and Transparency Efforts

A new platform called JeffTube launched to make the DOJ files easier to browse, addressing complaints about the difficulty of searching through millions of pages. The FBI holds thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's island operation that have not been released.

**Ghislaine Maxwell** offered to reveal the "truth" in exchange for clemency, according to reports. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.

## Debate Over Redaction Standards

The tension between transparency and legal procedure continues. Some experts have warned that releasing raw files could harm ongoing investigations. The FBI explained that files remain heavily redacted due to privacy concerns and active investigations.

Bondi defended the release in multiple settings, saying the DOJ released "all" Epstein files with full names listed. However, studies showing only 2% are fully visible contradict that assertion. She also accused lawmakers of receiving a "complete" release and listed 300 names in the files.

Critics note that Bondi named dead celebrities in her list, leading to accusations from Congress that she was "mudding" the list to obscure more significant connections.

## Ongoing Congressional Activity

Congress has subpoenaed multiple individuals, including UK politician Peter Mandelson and billionaire Les Wexner. One lawmaker named six men hidden in the files despite the Epstein Transparency Act requiring disclosure.

Rep. Khanna stated that Epstein's network "knew enough to know better" in recent comments. The California representative has positioned himself as a leading voice demanding accountability.

The files have affected state-level politics as well. Texas GOP expressed alarm over comptroller candidate Don Huffines, whose family bought Epstein's Zorro Ranch for $13.4 million. Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner, Epstein's former business partner.

The clash between Clinton and the White House, combined with Khanna's call to "stop protecting predators," signals that the political battle over Epstein file transparency will continue. Congressional hearings remain scheduled, and multiple international investigations are ongoing.
