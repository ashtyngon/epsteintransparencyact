Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) described the contents of the Epstein files as revealing "true evil" during a launch party event, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Massie made the remarks at an event where he also discussed former President Donald Trump, the Enquirer reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The newspaper did not provide additional details about what specific contents of the files Massie referenced or the nature of the launch party.

The Kentucky congressman has emerged as one of the most outspoken Republican critics of how the Justice Department has handled document releases related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Massie [previously declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files and later [said he had lost confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over redactions in the released documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Massie voted in favor of the Epstein Transparency Act, which passed the House unanimously in December 2024 and was signed into law by President Trump in January 2026.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The law requires federal agencies to review and disclose records related to Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.

## Recent Tensions Over File Releases

The congressman has [criticized the Trump Justice Department over extensive redactions](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) in documents released under the transparency law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Massie and other lawmakers have said the redacted releases fall short of the law's intent to provide full disclosure of government records related to Epstein's activities and connections.

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges related to recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein.
