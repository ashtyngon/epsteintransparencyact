Guardian columnist Arwa Mahdawi wrote that the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on Thursday demonstrates a contrast between how the United Kingdom and United States hold powerful figures accountable in matters related to Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"Prominent Brits are facing a reckoning over Epstein. In the US, not so much," Mahdawi wrote in a column published Saturday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

British officials stated "nobody is above the law" following Andrew's arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office, according to Mahdawi.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The arrest occurred on Andrew's 66th birthday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Arrest Details

Andrew, formerly known as Prince Andrew, was brought in for police questioning on Thursday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> A photograph captured him leaving the police station after the questioning.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Mahdawi wrote that "bad things never seem to happen to bad people" and described accountability as "fleetingly rare," making Andrew's arrest significant.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She described the arrest as happening to Andrew "like a mere commoner" despite his royal status.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Police [widened their investigation](/news/2026-02-22-police-widen-prince-andrew-investigation-after-epstein-files-arrest) into Andrew following document releases under the Epstein Transparency Act, according to reports published earlier this week.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown [called for a probe](/news/2026-02-22-gordon-brown-demands-probe-into-andrew-s-raf-base-epstein-meetings) into Andrew's meetings with Epstein at Royal Air Force bases, according to reports from Friday.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Background on Epstein Connection

Virginia Giuffre alleged in court filings that she was trafficked to Andrew by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell when she was 17 years old.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Andrew gave a November 2019 BBC interview discussing his friendship with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Andrew settled a civil lawsuit filed by Giuffre in February 2022.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The settlement included no admission of liability.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2025, mandated the release of government records related to Epstein's case.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>
