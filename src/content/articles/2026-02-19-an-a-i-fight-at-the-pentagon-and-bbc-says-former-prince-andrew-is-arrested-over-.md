## Prince Andrew's Epstein Connections

Prince Andrew, the Duke of York and third child of Queen Elizabeth II, faced allegations of sexual abuse in connection with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> 

In 2022, he reached a settlement in a civil lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sexual encounters with the prince when she was 17.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The settlement, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, did not include an admission of liability.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Court documents showed Andrew agreed to make a "substantial donation" to Giuffre's charity supporting victims' rights.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Following the allegations and settlement, Buckingham Palace stripped Prince Andrew of his military titles and royal patronages in January 2022.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> He stopped using the title "His Royal Highness" in an official capacity.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>
