Baltimore Orioles owner David Rubenstein met with Jeffrey Epstein in 2012, four years after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Palm Beach County to soliciting prostitution from a minor — a deal negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta that resulted in just 13 months of county jail with work release, according to newly released files reported by CBS News.

Rubenstein, the billionaire co-founder of the Carlyle Group, has not commented on the meeting. Neither the Orioles nor Carlyle Group has issued a statement.

The 2012 meeting occurred during a period when Epstein, despite his status as a registered sex offender, continued to cultivate relationships with some of America's wealthiest figures. His 2008 guilty plea and conviction were matters of public record, widely reported in business and financial media.

## Following the Money

Rubenstein built his fortune through Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms managing hundreds of billions in assets. Forbes estimates his net worth at roughly $3.6 billion. He purchased the Orioles in 2024 for approximately $1.7 billion.

The files don't detail what Rubenstein and Epstein discussed or where they met. But the timing matters: by 2012, anyone meeting with Epstein knew exactly who they were meeting with.

## Silence from the Elite

Rubenstein's lack of response follows a familiar pattern among those named in Epstein documents. [Joe Rogan addressed his appearance](/news/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-epstein-files-scare-the-hell-out-of-me) in the files, explaining the limited context of his contact. Most others have stayed quiet.

The documents continue to surface as journalists work through [millions of files](/news/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) released following passage of [the Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law). Each new name raises the same question: What did they know about Epstein's criminal history, and why did they maintain contact with a convicted sex offender?

For Rubenstein—a public figure who now owns a major league baseball team—the 2012 meeting presents a reputational problem that silence won't resolve. Epstein's conviction wasn't hidden or obscure. It was public, documented, and easily discoverable by anyone with basic due diligence capabilities, let alone the resources of a multi-billion dollar private equity firm.
