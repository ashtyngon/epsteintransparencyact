**Federal investigators failed to locate at least six storage units connected to Jeffrey Epstein**, according to a report by WION published Tuesday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The storage facilities were not recovered during the FBI's investigation following Epstein's death in August 2019.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

WION reported that the six storage units were "secret" and "missed by FBI."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The outlet's report did not specify the locations of the facilities or detail their contents.

The discovery adds to prior reporting on [Epstein's undisclosed storage facilities across the United States](/news/2026-02-23-epstein-secret-storage-units-across-us-contain-unreleased-evidence). The Telegraph [reported on February 22](/news/2026-02-22-telegraph-reports-epstein-hidden-storage-units-across-us) that multiple hidden storage locations remained unexamined by federal authorities.

## Previous FBI Searches

Federal investigators conducted extensive searches of Epstein's properties following his arrest in July 2019. FBI agents executed search warrants at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse on East 71st Street, recovering thousands of photographs of young women and girls, along with compact discs labeled with names and dates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Agents also searched Epstein's private island, Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. That search yielded computer hard drives, photo albums, and business records. Federal authorities conducted a separate search of Epstein's Zorro Ranch in Stanley, New Mexico, seizing electronic devices and documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Materials from those searches were used in the prosecution of **Ghislaine Maxwell**, Epstein's longtime associate. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges of recruiting and grooming minors for abuse. Prosecutors presented evidence including flight logs, photographs, and financial records recovered from Epstein's properties.

## Transparency Act Requirements

The [Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2025](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), mandates the declassification and release of federal records related to Epstein's crimes and associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The FBI began its formal review of covered documents in late 2025.

Congressional investigators have sought access to records from multiple federal agencies about contacts with Epstein and the scope of investigative efforts. The existence of unretrieved storage units could affect those inquiries if materials relevant to congressional subpoenas remain unrecovered.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Jeffrey Epstein** died by apparent suicide in a Manhattan federal jail on August 10, 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had been arrested on July 6, 2019, after his private jet landed at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.

Epstein was previously convicted in 2008 in Florida on state charges of soliciting a minor. He served 13 months in a county jail under a work-release arrangement.
