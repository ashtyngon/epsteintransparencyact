The family of Virginia Giuffre released a statement Thursday saying their "broken hearts have been lifted" following the [arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-on-document-sharing-charges-in-epstein-case), the former Prince Andrew.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"At last. Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law," the family wrote.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The statement came the same day U.K. authorities arrested the former prince on charges related to the Epstein case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Giuffre's Allegations Against Andrew

Giuffre alleged that Mountbatten-Windsor sexually abused her after she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> 

She has publicly stated that Epstein trafficked her and forced her to have sexual encounters with the former prince when she was 17 years old. Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew in U.S. federal court in August 2021, alleging sexual abuse.

Andrew denied the allegations. He reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in February 2022. Following the settlement, Queen Elizabeth II stripped him of his military titles and royal patronages. He stopped using the title "His Royal Highness" in any official capacity in January 2022.

## Context on Epstein Case

Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on five counts related to sex trafficking of minors and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

Giuffre testified during Maxwell's trial that she was recruited at age 16 to give massages to Epstein at his Palm Beach estate and was trained by Maxwell to provide sexual services.

The arrest follows the release of thousands of pages of documents related to Epstein's associates in recent weeks. The releases came under court orders and the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which triggered a federal review of Epstein-related records.

Andrew's name appeared in multiple documents released as part of ongoing litigation and investigations. Thursday's statement marks the first public comment from the Giuffre family since the arrest was announced.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
