# Attorney General Faces Congressional Questioning on Epstein Files Release

**Attorney General Pam Bondi** faced questioning from Congress over the status of **Epstein files**, federal shooting incidents, and surveillance practices, according to a report from **Jurist.org** published **February 13, 2026**. The hearing addressed multiple pressing law enforcement matters, with lawmakers seeking answers on the handling of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

The questioning comes amid ongoing calls for transparency surrounding the Epstein case files. The **Epstein Transparency Act** and related legislative efforts have put pressure on federal officials to release documents that could shed light on Epstein's network and associates.

## Congressional Hearing Details

During the hearing, Attorney General Bondi addressed inquiries about the federal government's approach to Epstein-related documents. The session also covered federal shooting incidents and surveillance practices, though specific details about these topics were not elaborated in the initial report.

The hearing represents continued congressional oversight of how the Department of Justice handles sensitive case files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who died in federal custody in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges.

## Broader Implications for Transparency

Congressional questioning of the Attorney General signals ongoing legislative interest in Epstein case transparency. Lawmakers from both parties have previously expressed support for releasing documents that could provide clarity about Epstein's connections and activities.

The hearing may influence future decisions about document declassification and public release. Advocacy groups and members of Congress continue to push for fuller disclosure of government files related to the case.

Further details about Attorney General Bondi's responses and specific commitments made during the hearing were not available in the initial report. Additional coverage of the congressional session is expected as transcripts become available.
