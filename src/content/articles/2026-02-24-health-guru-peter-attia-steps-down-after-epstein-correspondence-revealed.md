## Timing and Disclosure

The timing of when Attia's emails with Epstein were sent remains unclear from available reporting.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The disclosure comes as [multiple prominent figures have resigned](https://www.epsteintransparencyact.com/news/2026-02-23-doj-epstein-files-release-sparks-global-resignations-new-probes) after their names appeared in documents related to Epstein that have been made public in recent weeks.

Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor. He died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.
