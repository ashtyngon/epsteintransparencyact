French prosecutors are examining three new complaints linked to the recently released Epstein files, the Paris prosecutor's office said. The office is also revisiting an earlier investigation into an Epstein associate who died in 2022.

The prosecutor's office did not identify the individuals named in the complaints or provide details about the allegations. French law restricts disclosure of information about ongoing investigations.

The complaints stem from documents released under U.S. legislation passed last year. France [set up a specialized team last week](/articles/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review the files for French nationals who had contact with Epstein.

## Europe Responds

The French action follows other European responses to the document release. [Dubai's ports chief resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails surfaced. [UK police launched a national task force](/articles/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations.

Congress [subpoenaed British diplomat Peter Mandelson](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) over his documented meetings with Epstein.

In the United States, Attorney General Pam Bondi has [resisted calls to release unredacted versions](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) of the documents. The FBI [released files with significant portions redacted](/articles/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted), citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.
