**Casey Wasserman**, the Los Angeles entertainment executive leading preparations for the **2028 Olympic Games** and grandson of MCA founder Lew Wasserman, is preparing to sell his entertainment agency after clients departed following the publication of his email correspondence with **Ghislaine Maxwell**, according to The New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Maxwell was convicted on December 29, 2021 on five counts of sex trafficking and conspiracy, and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. The sale follows the Justice Department's release of 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos of Epstein-related documents under the Transparency Act signed November 19, 2025.

Wasserman's decision to divest from the Wasserman Media Group -- which he founded -- comes as newly released emails show direct communication between the Olympic committee leader and Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's longtime associate convicted on sex trafficking charges, according to The New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Times reported that Wasserman "has lost clients since his emails with Ghislaine Maxwell surfaced."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Accelerating Corporate Reckoning

Wasserman joins a list of executives who have departed their positions since the document releases began. Within the past week, [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after emails referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey." [DP World's CEO resigned](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after his name appeared thousands of times in the files. Multiple [college presidents and professors](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) have stepped down or faced pressure.

As chairman of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee, Wasserman has been the public face of the city's Olympic preparations, meeting with sponsors, government officials, and international sports leaders.

PBS NewsHour reported Friday that Goldman Sachs' resignation came after "emails showed her close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein."

According to LawFuel, the email releases have also reached into international law firms, with documents naming a former Clifford Chance trainee.

## DOJ Response

**Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche** on Friday criticized **Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.)** and **Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)** for naming individuals in House floor speeches. Blanche accused the lawmakers of naming "completely random people" and characterized their approach as reckless, according to The Hill.

The Hill reported that Khanna and Massie "have been at the forefront of a bipartisan push to release all of the files" related to Epstein. The DOJ has stated that many names in the files belong to individuals without criminal culpability. Khanna and Massie have argued that the public should know the full scope of individuals named in Epstein's records.

Rep. Massie, speaking to Spectrum News about recent CEO resignations, defended the transparency push. Massie previously identified six men on the House floor whose identities remain redacted in official documents.

Some names have become public through floor speeches and media reports while the same names remain redacted in official documents. Attorney General Bondi has faced questioning about this dynamic.

## Epstein's Reach Into Academia: The Alabama Connection

WVTM reported that DOJ records indicate **Jeffrey Epstein was involved in arranging** a **guest speaker at the University of Alabama**. The report is part of broader reporting on college presidents and professors named in the files.

The documents show contacts between Epstein and academic institutions beyond Harvard and MIT, where his donations and relationships have been previously reported. Universities named in the files have not taken the same actions as corporations whose executives resigned after being named.

## The Wexner Money Trail: Campaign Finance Complications

Congress subpoenaed billionaire Leslie Wexner to testify about his decades-long relationship with Epstein. WFMJ reported that **Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner**, whom members of Congress have described as an alleged co-conspirator.

Wexner, the founder of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands and Epstein's only confirmed financial client, employed Epstein as his financial adviser, according to public records. Documents show Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion at 9 East 71st Street to Epstein for $0. Epstein operated out of that mansion until his arrest in July 2019.

WFMJ's review of campaign finance records showed Wexner's donations to Ohio politicians spanning multiple election cycles. The outlet did not specify which politicians received the contributions or the amounts.

## Elite Law Firms in the Spotlight

Legal industry publication Above the Law reported on **Brad Karp**, the chairman of law firm **Paul, Weiss**, and his firm's connections appearing in the documents.

The scrutiny of Karp and Paul, Weiss comes as multiple law firms face questions about partners' or clients' connections to Epstein. The Goldman Sachs general counsel's resignation showed that senior legal professionals have also been affected by the document releases.

## What the Documents Show

The emails and records released so far include:

**Direct correspondence** between Epstein, Maxwell, and hundreds of figures in business, politics, academia, and entertainment. Many of these communications concern meeting requests, dinner invitations, introductions, and thank-you notes.

**Financial relationships** including money management, investments, donations, and business dealings. Some documents show Epstein facilitating introductions between wealthy individuals and institutions seeking funding.

**Social connections** documented through flight logs, phone records, and email threads showing attendance at dinners, parties, and events. Many names appear as guests at large gatherings.

The released portions of the documents generally do not contain direct evidence of criminal conduct by most of the named individuals. The majority of people mentioned in the files have not been accused of crimes. Being named in Epstein's contacts does not constitute evidence of criminal knowledge or participation.

## Document Release Status

Large volumes of information are now public, but the DOJ's heavy redactions continue despite the passage of the Epstein Transparency Act. Allegations also emerged that DOJ was tracking which lawmakers searched the files.

Congressional critics have stated that the redactions protect prominent individuals. Rep. Khanna and others have used floor speeches to name individuals whose names remain officially redacted in the documents.

## LA 2028 Olympics

Wasserman's planned sale of his agency has raised questions about his continued leadership of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee. The International Olympic Committee has not commented publicly on Wasserman's status.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Continuing Investigation

Courts are allowing civil cases to proceed. Congressional committees have issued subpoenas to key figures including Wexner and Lord Mandelson.

The New York Times has launched a major investigation into the millions of pages of documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The DOJ has stated that most people in the files are not targets of criminal investigation. No criminal charges beyond those brought against Ghislaine Maxwell have been announced in connection with the document releases. Additional document releases are expected under the Transparency Act's provisions.
