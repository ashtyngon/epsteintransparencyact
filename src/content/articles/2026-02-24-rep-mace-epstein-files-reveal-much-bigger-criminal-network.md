Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) told The Hill the Jeffrey Epstein case involves more than the sex crimes for which he was charged, stating: "This is much bigger than a prostitution and sex trafficking ring."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The statement adds to Mace's ongoing scrutiny of federal document releases related to Epstein. She has [previously accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) in the initial files release and [demanded unredacted co-conspirator documents](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files) from the Justice Department.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Transparency Act Implementation

Federal agencies are implementing the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in January 2026.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The legislation mandates declassification and public release of government documents related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates.

The law establishes specific timelines for different categories of records. Agencies must identify relevant documents, review them for declassification, and release materials that meet the statute's requirements. The FBI began its formal review process following enactment of the law.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) stated that the Department of Justice withheld FBI interviews with a Trump accuser from the initial document release.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The extent of what remains unreleased under the new law continues to generate congressional scrutiny.

## Epstein's Criminal History

Jeffrey Epstein was a financier who faced state charges in Florida in 2008 for soliciting a minor. He served 13 months under a controversial plea agreement that allowed work release during daytime hours.

Federal prosecutors in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking in July 2019. He died in federal custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan on August 10, 2019, while awaiting trial. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence in federal custody.

Court documents unsealed in January 2024 revealed names of more than 150 individuals mentioned in civil litigation related to Epstein's activities. Inclusion in the documents does not indicate criminal wrongdoing.

## Congressional Oversight

Mace represents South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. She has previously spoken on issues related to sexual assault and victim advocacy during her time in Congress.

The congresswoman's characterization of the case as extending beyond documented sex crimes reflects ongoing questions about the full scope of Epstein's activities and network of associates. Congressional oversight of the document release process continues as federal agencies work through materials covered by the transparency law.

The Transparency Act passed both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support before Trump signed it into law. The legislation built on years of advocacy by survivors and transparency advocates seeking full disclosure of government records related to the case.
