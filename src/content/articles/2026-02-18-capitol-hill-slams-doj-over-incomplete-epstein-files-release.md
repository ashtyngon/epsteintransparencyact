## Democrats Challenge Wexner Testimony After Eight-Hour Deposition

**Rep. Robert Garcia** called the testimony of billionaire **Leslie Wexner** inadequate after an eight-hour closed-door deposition in which the former Victoria's Secret owner denied knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The deposition took place Wednesday in **New Albany, Ohio**, where the **88-year-old** Wexner lives.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"[Wexner] denied everything, and quite frankly, it would have been nice to see more remorse," Garcia, the top Democrat on the **House Oversight Committee**, told reporters midway through the deposition.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The session followed the Justice Department's identification of Wexner as a "co-conspirator" in recently released Epstein files, though he has not been charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Democrats said Wexner provided few new details during the deposition about his relationship with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The testimony comes as House Democrats have expressed skepticism about Wexner's longstanding claim that he was unaware of Epstein's criminal activities despite their decades-long financial relationship.

## Republican Absence From Ohio Deposition

No Republican members of the Oversight Committee were physically present at the New Albany deposition.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Democrats said the questioning was led by committee staff.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Chairman James Comer**, a Kentucky Republican, was absent from the deposition.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> A source familiar with the matter noted that Democrats did not attend the Clintons' scheduled deposition on Capitol Hill in January.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The partisan divide over witness depositions has become a recurring feature of the Oversight Committee's investigation into Epstein-related matters. Democrats attended the Wexner deposition in Ohio, while Republicans had attended separate depositions in Washington earlier this year.

## DOJ Name Release Draws Congressional Criticism

The deposition occurred the same day the Justice Department released what lawmakers say is its final disclosure under the **Epstein Files Transparency Act**.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The release included a list of names described as "disparate as Janis Joplin, Julian Assange and former Vice President Dick Cheney."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The disclosure has sparked an outcry on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are accusing the DOJ of failing to comply with its obligations under the transparency law.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The criticism centers on whether the department has fully met the requirements of the act, which mandated the release of documents related to Epstein's activities and associations.

The timing of the name release alongside the Wexner deposition highlights the ongoing congressional scrutiny of both the Epstein investigation itself and the government's handling of related records. The Hill reported that members of Congress view the DOJ's disclosure as falling short of the transparency mandate established by the act.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Allegations Surface in Unredacted Files

The Justice Department's release of Epstein files has included previously redacted material that contains serious allegations. **Rep. Ted Lieu** referenced unredacted documents that contain allegations regarding former President Trump.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The Times Now article reported that Lieu cited unredacted files containing allegations that Trump engaged in criminal conduct involving minors.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The specific allegations referenced by Lieu involve claims of rape and threats to kill minors, according to the Times Now report.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The unredacted documents represent a new phase in the public disclosure of Epstein-related materials. Previous releases had included heavy redactions, particularly of names and specific allegations. The removal of some redactions has led to renewed attention on individuals named in the files.

## Campbell's Denial of Illegal Activity Knowledge

**Naomi Campbell**, the supermodel, has stated she had no involvement with Epstein's illegal activities despite appearing in documents related to his social circle.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Black Enterprise reported that Campbell stayed in Epstein's orbit but denies ties to his illegal dealings.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Campbell's name appears in materials documenting Epstein's extensive network of social and professional contacts. The documents show she maintained contact with Epstein over a period of years, though the nature and frequency of their interactions remains a subject of public record review.

The supermodel joins numerous other public figures who have acknowledged social contact with Epstein while denying knowledge of or participation in criminal activities. Her statement adds to the pattern of individuals in Epstein's social sphere drawing distinctions between lawful social contact and awareness of illegal conduct.

## Wexner's Decades-Long Financial Ties

Wexner served as Epstein's primary client for years, granting him power of attorney over his financial affairs.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The relationship included Epstein's management of substantial assets belonging to Wexner and his companies. Public records show Epstein purchased Wexner's New York mansion, which later became central to criminal allegations against Epstein.

The designation of Wexner as a "co-conspirator" in Justice Department documents marks a significant development in the public record of his relationship with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The label appears in files released under the transparency act, though federal prosecutors have not brought charges against him.

Democrats on the Oversight Committee have indicated their dissatisfaction with Wexner's explanations of the relationship. Garcia's statement about wanting "more remorse" suggests Democratic members believe Wexner bears some responsibility for enabling Epstein's activities through their business arrangement.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Next Steps in Congressional Investigation

The Oversight Committee has not announced whether it will require additional testimony from Wexner. Garcia's characterization of the deposition as insufficient leaves open the possibility of further congressional action. Democrats may seek additional documents or testimony to fill what they view as gaps in Wexner's account.

The committee continues to conduct depositions of individuals named in the Epstein files. The partisan nature of attendance at these depositions—with Democrats traveling to Ohio for Wexner while Republicans attended Clinton depositions in Washington—indicates ongoing political divisions over the investigation's focus and scope.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Congressional criticism of the Justice Department's compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act may lead to additional oversight hearings.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Lawmakers have expressed concern that the department's interpretation of its obligations under the law does not match congressional intent when the legislation was enacted.
