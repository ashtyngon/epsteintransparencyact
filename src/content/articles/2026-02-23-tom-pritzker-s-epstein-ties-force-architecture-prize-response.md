The Pritzker Architecture Prize issued a statement after documents revealed that Tom Pritzker, chairman of the Hyatt Foundation which administers the prize, had ties to Jeffrey Epstein, The New York Times reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The revelation prompted the prize organization to address Pritzker's relationship with the deceased financier and convicted sex offender, according to the Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The disclosure adds Pritzker to the growing list of prominent business leaders whose associations with Epstein have come under public scrutiny following document releases.

## Pritzker's Role in Architecture Prize

Tom Pritzker serves as executive chairman of the Hyatt Foundation, the organization that has presented the Pritzker Architecture Prize annually since 1979.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The prize, often compared to a Nobel Prize in architecture, carries significant prestige in the field and comes with a $100,000 award and a bronze medallion.

The Pritzker family built their wealth primarily through the Hyatt hotel chain. Tom Pritzker is executive chairman of the Pritzker Organization, the family's private asset management firm.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The architecture prize represents one of the family's most visible philanthropic efforts, having recognized more than 50 architects since its founding.

## Epstein's Network Among Business Elite

Epstein cultivated relationships with numerous wealthy and influential individuals across business, academia, and philanthropy before his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He was arrested again in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges.

Multiple organizations and institutions have faced questions about their principals' connections to Epstein or donations they accepted from him. Several universities, including MIT and Harvard, conducted reviews of their ties to Epstein after his 2019 arrest.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito resigned in September 2019 after reports detailed the lab's financial relationship with Epstein and efforts to conceal his donations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> [Other business leaders have resigned](/news/2026-02-17-hyatt-billionaire-thomas-pritzker-resigns-over-epstein-ties) or faced scrutiny as Epstein-related documents continue to emerge.

## Architecture Prize Administration

The Hyatt Foundation typically announces each year's Pritzker Prize laureate in early spring, with a formal ceremony held later in the year at an architecturally significant location.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Recent laureates have included architects recognized for advancing sustainable design and social housing projects.

Epstein died by suicide in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in a Manhattan jail. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
