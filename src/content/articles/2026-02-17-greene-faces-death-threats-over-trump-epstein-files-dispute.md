## Trump Attacks Greene as Death Threats Mount

Marjorie Taylor Greene says she has faced hundreds of death threats since breaking with Donald Trump over the release of Jeffrey Epstein files, as the former president launched a social media attack on the former Georgia congresswoman.

Trump used his platform to criticize Greene, marking their first direct public exchange since she challenged his administration's handling of documents related to Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019.

Greene did not specify whether the threats came from Trump supporters or other sources. The threats began after she publicly split with Trump over document transparency in late 2025.

## Break Over Epstein Files

The falling out became public when Greene [criticized Trump's handling of the Epstein files](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) as a "political miscalculation." She had been among the most vocal congressional supporters of releasing unredacted documents related to Epstein's network.

The Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi released what it characterized as complete Epstein files in February 2026, but [analysis showed only 2% of available documents were made public](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows).

[Representative Thomas Massie](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) and other lawmakers accused the DOJ of protecting names through redactions and selective release. [Representative Ro Khanna](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) and [Representative Nancy Mace](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files) challenged Bondi's claims that all relevant files had been disclosed.

## Political Pressure and Threats

The dispute over Epstein files has created divisions within Republican ranks. [Representative Massie declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted on lawmakers demanding full transparency. Massie stated he had [lost confidence in AG Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) after what he described as her avoidance of eye contact with Epstein survivors during congressional testimony.

Greene had been one of Trump's most consistent allies in Congress before the Epstein files dispute. Her break with the former president represented one of the most significant defections by a MAGA-aligned member of Congress.

Trump's attack on Greene comes as Georgia prepares for a special election to fill her former congressional seat.

## Broader Files Controversy

The Trump DOJ's handling of Epstein files has drawn criticism from multiple quarters. [Lawmakers accused Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) of "mudding" the list by including deceased celebrities alongside individuals who had substantive contact with Epstein.

[United Nations experts called for investigation](/news/2026-02-16-un-experts-call-for-investigation-into-epstein-files-warn-of-crimes-against-huma) into the Epstein network and warned of potential crimes against humanity. The files have triggered [resignations of executives and officials globally](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-files-trigger-global-resignations-new-investigations), including the [Dubai ports chief](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) and [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files).

Trump has [called for an end to Epstein investigations](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation), a position that put him at odds with transparency advocates like Greene and Massie. The Department of Justice has faced accusations of a [cover-up over file redactions](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions).

Greene's willingness to prioritize Epstein file transparency over party loyalty distinguished her from most Republican lawmakers, who have largely remained silent on the issue or supported the administration's limited release approach.
