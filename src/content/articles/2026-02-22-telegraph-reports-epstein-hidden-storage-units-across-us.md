**Jeffrey Epstein** maintained secret storage units containing files across the United States, **The Telegraph** reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The newspaper described the facilities as holding materials that have not been made public, located at multiple sites across the country.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Telegraph characterized the units as "secret" in its report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Telegraph did not disclose the specific locations of the storage units, how many facilities Epstein maintained, or what types of files they contained.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Evidence from Known Epstein Properties

Federal prosecutors previously seized extensive materials from Epstein's known properties during their investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The FBI documented thousands of photographs, videos, and documents during searches of his Manhattan mansion, his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and his New Mexico ranch.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His longtime associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted in December 2021 on five counts related to recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse.

The existence of additional storage facilities indicates Epstein distributed materials across multiple locations beyond his primary residences. Federal authorities have not publicly stated whether they were aware of these storage units before The Telegraph's report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Document Release Efforts

The **Epstein Transparency Act**, signed into law in January 2026, requires the release of FBI, Justice Department, and other federal agency records related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates. The FBI began its formal review of Epstein-related records shortly after the law took effect.

The agency has not provided a timeline for when it will complete document releases under the statute. Multiple jurisdictions continue to investigate individuals and institutions connected to Epstein's criminal network.

## Investigation Context

Federal searches of Epstein's properties occurred following his July 2019 arrest on sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors alleged Epstein operated a years-long scheme to sexually abuse dozens of underage girls at his residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.

The materials seized during those searches formed part of the evidence used in the prosecution of Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. Prosecutors presented testimony from multiple victims and documentary evidence showing Maxwell's role in facilitating Epstein's abuse.

The Telegraph's report did not indicate whether law enforcement agencies have accessed the storage facilities or whether the contents remain sealed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
