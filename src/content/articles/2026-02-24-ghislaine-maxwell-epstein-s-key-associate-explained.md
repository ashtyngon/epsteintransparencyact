**Ghislaine Maxwell** is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for sexual abuse by financier **Jeffrey Epstein**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Maxwell, now 63, was convicted in December 2021 on five counts related to sex trafficking minors.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She is serving her sentence at a low-security federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, with an expected release date in July 2037.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Background and Relationship with Epstein

The British socialite's relationship with Epstein began in the early 1990s.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Prosecutors presented evidence at trial that Maxwell recruited and groomed young girls, many of whom were underage, for sexual abuse.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Maxwell is the daughter of **Robert Maxwell**, a British media mogul who died in 1991 when he fell from his yacht near the Canary Islands.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> After her father's death, she relocated to New York, where her connection with Epstein deepened.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Her father had built a publishing empire before his death. Following his death and the subsequent collapse of his business empire, Maxwell moved to the United States and became closely associated with Epstein's social and business circles.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Trial and Conviction

Prosecutors presented evidence that Maxwell facilitated Epstein's abuse of underage girls between 1994 and 2004.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Survivors testified during the trial about the abuse they experienced and Maxwell's role in it.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Maxwell was arrested in July 2020 at a property in New Hampshire, approximately one year after Epstein's death in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Her December 2021 conviction came after a trial in which prosecutors argued she was an active and essential participant in Epstein's criminal enterprise.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The trial record showed Maxwell's role extended beyond recruitment. According to evidence presented at trial, she participated in some encounters and created an environment that made young girls feel safe in Epstein's presence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Current Status and Related Developments

Maxwell continues to serve her sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> [She has offered to reveal information about Epstein's network in exchange for clemency](/news/2026-02-15-ghislaine-maxwell-offers-to-reveal-truth-in-exchange-for-clemency), though no such agreement has been reached.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

[Maxwell is also fighting the release of 90,000 additional Epstein-related documents](/news/2026-02-21-ghislaine-maxwell-fights-release-of-90-000-epstein-files) that remain under court seal.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Her conviction is the only successful prosecution of a primary accomplice in Epstein's abuse operation. Epstein died before facing trial on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The five counts on which Maxwell was convicted included conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and three counts related to transporting minors for illegal sexual activity.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
