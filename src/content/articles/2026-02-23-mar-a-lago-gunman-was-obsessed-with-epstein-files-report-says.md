A man shot and killed by Secret Service agents while attempting to breach **Mar-a-Lago** on Saturday was fixated on the recently released Epstein files, according to text messages obtained by law enforcement.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The incident occurred as multiple stories related to the files continue to develop, including testimony from billionaire **Les Wexner** and ongoing investigations into **Prince Andrew** in the United Kingdom.

**Austin Tucker Martin** was fatally shot after he attempted to enter the Palm Beach resort carrying a firearm, according to the New York Post.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> TMZ reported that text messages reviewed by investigators showed Martin was "fixated on Epstein files."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The shooting comes amid heightened public attention to documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law in January requiring federal agencies to declassify records related to the late financier's activities.

## Wexner Testifies He Was 'Conned' by Epstein

Billionaire retail magnate **Les Wexner** testified that he was "conned" by **Jeffrey Epstein** and did not know of his crimes, according to the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Wexner founded the Limited Brands retail empire and had a longtime financial relationship with Epstein.

The testimony comes as **Maria Farmer**, who has accused Epstein and **Ghislaine Maxwell** of abuse, called Wexner's testimony "abhorrent" after she said she was abused at his Ohio estate.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Farmer has been a prominent voice among Epstein's accusers and previously provided detailed accounts of her experiences.

In response to the testimony, protesters gathered at **Ohio State University** demanding the institution remove Wexner's name from campus buildings, according to the Columbus Dispatch.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The university has several facilities bearing Wexner's name following his major donations to the institution over the years.

## RAF Base Documents Show Epstein-Linked Jet Landing

A jet linked to Jeffrey Epstein landed at a **Royal Air Force base** in **2013**, according to documents obtained by the Financial Times.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The revelation adds to questions about Epstein's access to secure government facilities in the United Kingdom.

Former U.K. Prime Minister **Gordon Brown** has demanded a probe into Prince Andrew's meetings with Epstein at RAF bases, according to previous reporting. The documents showing the 2013 landing provide new details about the extent of Epstein's connections to British military installations during the period when he maintained a relationship with the Duke of York.

## Police Guarded Epstein Dinner for Prince Andrew

U.K. police officers assigned to **Prince Andrew** guarded a **2010 dinner** with Jeffrey Epstein, according to India Today.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> The dinner occurred after Epstein had already been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida in 2008.

The revelation that Metropolitan Police officers provided security for the event has raised questions about the use of publicly funded protection for what appeared to be a private social engagement with a convicted sex offender. Previous reporting has shown that Met Police officers guarding Andrew were told to protect Epstein's London home, according to emails.

Prince Andrew was arrested last week and remains under investigation by U.K. authorities. Police have conducted searches at the **Royal Lodge**, his residence on the Windsor estate, as part of the ongoing investigation into his ties to Epstein.

The U.K. government has faced calls for a judge-led inquiry into Andrew's relationship with Epstein, with some lawmakers suggesting the government should consider removing Andrew from the line of royal succession. Multiple U.K. newspapers have called for a formal inquiry into the matter.

## Analysis Calls for Focus on Power Structures

An opinion piece in Eurasia Review argued that the Epstein case reveals systematic issues rather than isolated incidents.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> The piece was titled "Epstein. Evil In The Empire Of Power: Not Chaos, But Order."<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

The commentary comes as federal agencies continue to review and release documents under the Epstein Transparency Act. The FBI has begun its review of Epstein-related records under the new law, which requires multiple agencies to declassify materials related to the case.

Some records have been removed from the files during the release process. One report indicated that FBI interview records related to a Trump accuser were removed from the Epstein files, though the specific reasons for the redactions were not publicly disclosed.

The ongoing document releases have generated international attention, with investigations and calls for accountability spanning multiple countries. In the United States, Rep. **Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)** described the Epstein files as revealing "true evil" during a recent event.

The various developments this week underscore the continuing impact of the Epstein case on public figures, institutions, and government agencies more than five years after his death in federal custody.
