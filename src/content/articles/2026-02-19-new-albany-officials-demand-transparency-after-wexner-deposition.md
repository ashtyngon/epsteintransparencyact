Local officials in New Albany, Ohio are facing calls for greater transparency following Les Wexner's recent congressional testimony about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Community members are pressing local government for clarity about potential connections between Epstein and the central Ohio suburb where Wexner has been a major developer and philanthropic presence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The demands follow Wexner's deposition to Congress about his decades-long financial and personal ties to Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> [Wexner testified](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony) that he was "duped" by Epstein, who served as his financial manager until 2007.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## What New Albany Residents Are Asking

Residents and advocacy groups are seeking information about whether Epstein had any involvement in New Albany's development or local institutions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> 

Wexner has been instrumental in shaping New Albany through real estate development and charitable contributions. The billionaire founder of L Brands gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances in the 1990s.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

During his congressional testimony, Wexner stated that Epstein had misappropriated funds and misled him about various financial dealings.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Wexner has said he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after discovering financial irregularities.

## Local Officials Have Not Responded

Local officials have not yet issued detailed public statements addressing the specific concerns raised by community members.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Wexner Foundation has faced questions about whether any of its charitable activities involved Epstein or whether Epstein had access to foundation resources during his years working for Wexner.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner has maintained he had no knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities. Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges related to recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse.
