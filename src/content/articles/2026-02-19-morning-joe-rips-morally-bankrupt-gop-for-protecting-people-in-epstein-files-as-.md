## Prince Andrew Arrest

Prince Andrew, the former Duke of York, was arrested in the United Kingdom on charges involving document-sharing in connection with the Epstein files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The arrest marks a significant development in the ongoing international scrutiny of individuals connected to Jeffrey Epstein's network.

Prince Andrew previously stepped back from royal duties in November 2019 following a BBC interview about his relationship with Epstein. In 2022, he reached a settlement in a civil lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sexual encounters with the prince—claims Andrew has denied.

## Congressional Action on Epstein Files

Scarborough's criticism focused specifically on Republican members of Congress and their response to allegations involving American officials with ties to Epstein, according to The Independent's reporting.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The [Epstein Transparency Act was signed into law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) following bipartisan congressional action, requiring federal agencies to review and release certain records related to the Epstein investigation. Multiple [lawmakers have called for fuller transparency](/news/2026-02-18-capitol-hill-slams-doj-over-incomplete-epstein-files-release) in recent weeks as document releases have continued.

Jeffrey Epstein was a financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His former associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence after being convicted in December 2021 on charges including sex trafficking of minors.
