Congressional investigators will depose billionaire **Leslie Wexner** about his Jeffrey Epstein ties in **Ohio**, rather than in Washington as initially planned, The Columbus Dispatch reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner, 87, will give his deposition in Ohio rather than in the nation's capital, where Congress typically compels high-profile witnesses to appear.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Background on Wexner's Relationship with Epstein

The retail magnate's relationship with Epstein has drawn congressional attention since [a House Oversight Committee member labeled him a "co-conspirator"](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) in Epstein's alleged sex trafficking operation earlier this month.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

According to public records, Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred ownership of a Manhattan mansion at **9 East 71st Street** -- a property valued at approximately $77 million -- that, according to court filings, became a location where alleged abuse occurred.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The billionaire founder of **Victoria's Secret** and **L Brands** has stated Epstein manipulated him and that he severed ties in 2007.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The extent of his knowledge about Epstein's alleged crimes has not been established. Wexner is also the largest donor to **Ohio State University**, where the **Wexner Medical Center** bears his name.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Deposition Details

The Dispatch did not report when the Ohio deposition will occur, whether testimony will be under oath, or if transcripts will be released to the public.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner has never been charged with any crime related to Epstein. He has not provided detailed public testimony about his relationship with Epstein.
