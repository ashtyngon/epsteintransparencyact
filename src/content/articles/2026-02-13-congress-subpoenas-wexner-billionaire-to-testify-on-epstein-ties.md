Congressional investigators will depose billionaire **Leslie Wexner** about his Jeffrey Epstein ties in **Ohio**, backing away from their initial order that he testify in Washington, The Columbus Dispatch reported.

The location change represents a notable concession for a congressional investigation. Wexner, 87, will now give his deposition closer to home rather than in the nation's capital, where Congress typically compels high-profile witnesses to appear.

## Why Wexner Faces Scrutiny

The retail magnate's relationship with Epstein has drawn intense congressional attention since [a House Oversight Committee member publicly labeled him a "co-conspirator"](/articles/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) in Epstein's sex trafficking operation earlier this month.

Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred ownership of a Manhattan mansion at **9 East 71st Street**—a property valued at approximately $77 million—that became a hub for abuse. The billionaire founder of **Victoria's Secret** and **L Brands** claims Epstein manipulated him and that he severed ties in 2007. But the depth of his knowledge about Epstein's crimes remains unclear. Wexner is also the largest donor to **Ohio State University**, where the **Wexner Medical Center** bears his name.

## What's Not Known

The Dispatch did not report when the Ohio deposition will occur, whether testimony will be under oath, or if transcripts will be released to the public. Those details matter: private depositions with no public accountability have become a common way for powerful figures to avoid real scrutiny.

Congress has the authority to compel testimony in Washington. Allowing a witness to dictate terms—especially location—sends a signal about who holds leverage in the process.

Wexner has never been charged with any crime related to Epstein. But his prolonged silence and refusal to provide detailed public testimony keep him at the center of transparency demands as [federal agencies continue reviewing Epstein-related records](/articles/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law).
