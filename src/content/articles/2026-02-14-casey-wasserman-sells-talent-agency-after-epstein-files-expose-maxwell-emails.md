Casey Wasserman has put his talent agency up for sale following the release of emails showing flirtatious exchanges between him and Ghislaine Maxwell.

The emails, dated 2003, surfaced in recently disclosed Epstein files. The communications took place before Epstein's conviction in Florida.

The sale comes amid high-profile departures from the agency, according to The Independent.

## Other Agency Exits

The Wasserman sale follows other executive exits tied to the Epstein files. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in documents. The [chairman of DP World stepped down](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties) after emails revealed connections to Epstein's network.

Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking minors. The 2003 emails with Wasserman predate Epstein's criminal record.

Wasserman Media Group operates in sports and entertainment representation.
