Casey Wasserman has put his talent agency up for sale following the release of emails showing flirtatious exchanges between him and Ghislaine Maxwell.

The emails, dated 2003, surfaced in recently disclosed Epstein files. The communications took place before Epstein's conviction in Florida.

The sale comes amid high-profile departures from the agency, according to The Independent.

## Other Agency Exits

The Wasserman sale follows other executive exits tied to the Epstein files.

Maxwell was convicted on December 29, 2021 of sex trafficking minors and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. The 2003 emails with Wasserman predate Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Palm Beach County.

Wasserman Media Group operates in sports and entertainment representation.
