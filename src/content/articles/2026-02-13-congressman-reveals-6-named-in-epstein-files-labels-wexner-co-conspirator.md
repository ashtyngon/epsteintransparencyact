**Rep. Ro Khanna** publicly disclosed the identities of **six men** whose names were redacted in the **Jeffrey Epstein files** during a congressional floor speech on **Tuesday, February 10, 2026**. The revelation came after Khanna and **Rep. Thomas Massie** reviewed unredacted documents at the **Department of Justice** for two hours.

The disclosure marks a significant development in ongoing efforts to bring transparency to the Epstein case. Among those named was **Leslie Wexner**, a billionaire retail magnate whom the FBI appeared to have labeled as a co-conspirator, according to Khanna's statements.

## Congressional Review of Unredacted Documents

Khanna, a **Democratic representative from California**, and Massie, a **Republican congressman from Kentucky**, conducted their review of the unredacted Epstein documents at the Department of Justice before Khanna's floor speech. The bipartisan effort represents continued congressional pressure for greater transparency in the Epstein investigation.

The congressman's decision to publicly name the six individuals follows mounting calls for the release of redacted information in the Epstein files. While Khanna disclosed Wexner's name and his apparent designation by the FBI, the source does not specify the identities of the other five men named in the speech.

## Wexner's Alleged FBI Designation

According to Khanna's statements, the FBI appeared to have labeled Leslie Wexner as a co-conspirator in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. Wexner, the founder of L Brands (now Victoria's Secret parent company), has previously acknowledged a professional and financial relationship with Epstein that ended in 2007.

The congressional review and subsequent disclosure may signal increased momentum for broader release of Epstein-related documents. Whether additional redacted names will be revealed or if formal action will follow Khanna's disclosure remains to be seen.
