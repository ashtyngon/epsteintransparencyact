## LA28 Leadership Crisis

Wasserman heads the organizing committee for the 2028 Summer Olympics scheduled for Los Angeles.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The LA28 committee is responsible for planning and executing all aspects of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, which are set to begin in approximately two years.

The organizing committee operates as a private nonprofit under the oversight of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee. The committee has worked with city, state, and federal officials to prepare venues, logistics, and security for the games.

Bass has been involved in coordination efforts as the city's chief executive and has represented Los Angeles in discussions with Olympic officials.

No response from Wasserman to the mayor's statement was reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The California Globe report did not specify when the emails between Wasserman and Epstein were sent, how they were discovered, or what communications they contained.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Epstein Files Disclosure

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His former associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges related to recruiting and grooming underage girls for sexual abuse.

The disclosure of Epstein's communications and relationships has led to resignations and investigations involving prominent figures in politics, business, entertainment, and academia since the release of files in February 2026.
