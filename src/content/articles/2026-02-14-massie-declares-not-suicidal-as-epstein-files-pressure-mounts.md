**Rep. Thomas Massie** (R-KY), co-author of the Epstein Transparency Act, posted a public statement on X on February 13 declaring that he is "not suicidal," according to Mediaite.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"I am not suicidal. I eat healthy food," Massie wrote. "The brakes on my car and truck are in good shape. I practice good trigger discipline and never point a gun at anyone, including myself. There are no deep pools of water on my farm and I'm a pretty good swimmer."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

He added: "It's true that my political career is on the line, my political life, but my own health and well-being could very well be too. I've upset a lot of billionaires who obviously aren't of high moral character and have done some really shady stuff."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Context

The statement followed Massie and **Rep. Ro Khanna's** (D-CA) [review of unredacted versions of the Epstein files](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) at the Department of Justice earlier this week. They announced that at least **six men's names** had been redacted from public releases -- men who, Massie said, are "likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Following the disclosure, **Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem**, CEO and chairman of the Dubai-based shipping company **DP World**, [resigned](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after Massie confirmed he was the recipient of an April 24, 2009 email from Epstein that read: "where are you? are you ok I loved the torture video." Bin Sulayem's name appeared more than **4,700 times** across the released files, and his correspondence with Epstein included discussions of masseuses, sexual encounters, escort services, and pornography, according to the documents.

Canada's second-largest pension fund, **La Caisse de depot**, paused over **$5 billion** in investments with DP World. Britain's development finance arm halted new deals involving the company's African port operations.

## Massie's Accusation

Massie said his concerns grew after an exchange with **Attorney General Pam Bondi**, according to Mediaite.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> When Bondi distributed folders to social media influencers labeled "The Epstein Files: Phase 1," Massie asked when Phase 2 would come. Bondi reportedly responded that nothing remained but child exploitation material.

"At that point," Massie said, "I concluded the administration had undertaken a cover-up and had no intention of releasing these files."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

He subsequently stated he would use his Congressional Speech or Debate Clause immunity to [read redacted names into the public record](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) on the House floor. Khanna did so, reading six names from the House floor.

Bondi was questioned during Congressional testimony about the redactions. Trump called for ending the investigation, stating the matter had been "investigated enough."

## Similar Statements by Other Lawmakers

Former **Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** responded to Massie's post: "These are not the type of public statements that any of us should have to make. But I'll back this up as his friend. Thomas is one of the happiest people I know. He loves his kids and grandkids. He loves his wife. He loves his life. And he loves our country and Kentucky."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Greene had previously written: "If something happens to me, I ask you all to find out" who might be trying "to stop the information from coming out."

**Rep. Nancy Mace** (R-SC) made a similar statement. Epstein died at the **Metropolitan Correctional Center** on **August 10, 2019**, in a death that was ruled a suicide.

## Political Consequences

**President Trump** has stated he will support a primary challenger against Massie in Kentucky, and Massie acknowledged it "would be a whole lot easier politically to get reelected" if he dropped the Epstein issue, according to Mediaite.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Massie told reporters the Epstein files are "bigger than Watergate" and that meeting with survivors of Epstein's alleged trafficking network convinced him to continue pursuing full transparency.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act, which Massie co-authored with Khanna, passed the House **427 to 1** and the Senate unanimously before being signed into law on **November 19, 2025**. The DOJ has released documents with extensive redactions that the FBI has defended as legally necessary. Massie has stated his review of unredacted files contradicts the DOJ's justifications for those redactions.

"It was not a hoax, I cannot be bullied, I am not done," Massie wrote on X, "and this is why those in power are doing everything in their power to defeat me."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
