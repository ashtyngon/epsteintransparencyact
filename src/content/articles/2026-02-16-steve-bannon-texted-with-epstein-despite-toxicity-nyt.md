**Steve Bannon** maintained contact with **Jeffrey Epstein** for years after the financier's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor, according to newly released text messages and emails in the DOJ's February file release.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The messages show Bannon continued communicating with Epstein through at least 2019, months before Epstein's arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.

The communications document a relationship that went beyond casual acquaintance, according to the New York Times. Bannon, who served as chief strategist to President Trump before becoming a media figure, told the Times the relationship was tactical -- he sought to get Epstein to "open up" about his connections to powerful figures. The Times described the texts as showing a "seemingly chummy relationship" that persisted despite Epstein's status as a registered sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Documents show the two men discussed politics, media strategy, and mutual contacts. In one exchange previously [reported on this site](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files), Bannon and Epstein discussed Pope Francis, according to DOJ files released February 15.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Post-Conviction Access

The Bannon-Epstein communications add to documentation of how Epstein maintained contact with prominent figures after his 2008 guilty plea. As documented in [prior reporting](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-invited-to-congressional-galas-years-after-arrest-docs-show), Epstein received invitations to congressional events years after his arrest.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Other files show he maintained contact with figures including [Nobel Prize administrators](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-used-nobel-prize-access-to-lure-elite-network-files-show), media executives, and university officials.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The exact timeline of Bannon's contact with Epstein remains unclear, as the DOJ released files contain redactions that **Rep. Thomas Massie** and others in Congress have criticized.

## Britain's Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

Separately, **Transparency International UK** released analysis of emails between Epstein and **Peter Mandelson**, the British politician who received a congressional subpoena to testify about his Epstein contacts. The anti-corruption organization's review focuses on what the communications show about gaps in UK lobbying regulations.

The emails document Epstein seeking political connections in Britain, according to Transparency International UK's February 16 analysis. Mandelson has previously stated he had limited contact with Epstein and was unaware of the extent of his criminal activity. The organization did not accuse Mandelson of wrongdoing but used the case to highlight weaknesses in British disclosure requirements for political figures' outside contacts.

UK authorities have established a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations connected to Epstein's UK activities. Britain's top prosecutor stated in February that "nobody is above the law" as police examine **Prince Andrew's** connections, which have come under renewed scrutiny after files showed an aide advised Epstein on concealing his conviction on visa forms.

## Midwest Lawmakers Face Questions

In Minnesota and Iowa, federal lawmakers face questions about whether they plan to review unredacted Epstein files, according to a February 16 report by KTTC Rochester. The article did not specify which lawmakers had been contacted or detail their responses.

Congressional access to unredacted files has become a point of contention. **Attorney General Pam Bondi** told lawmakers she released "all" available Epstein files and provided a list of approximately 300 names. Members of Congress, however, have accused the DOJ of padding the list with deceased celebrities and maintaining extensive redactions.

**Rep. Ro Khanna** called on the DOJ to release unredacted files in a February 16 statement. **Rep. Nancy Mace** has called for unredacted co-conspirator files. **Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** called Trump's handling of the file release a "political miscalculation."

An independent analysis found the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files in its possession, according to a study released February 16. The FBI has stated it maintains thousands of files related to Epstein's operations. An expert noted that releasing raw files without proper review could affect ongoing investigations.

## International Response

**France** has established a special team to review files for French nationals, and prosecutors there are investigating a diplomat whose name appeared in the releases. **United Nations experts** called for investigation into the files in February, stating the documents may contain evidence of crimes against humanity.

The files have prompted resignations and investigations globally. Recent departures include Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, Dubai's ports chief, **Casey Wasserman** who sold his sports marketing agency, and **Tom Pritzker** of the Hyatt hotel family who stepped down after contact with Epstein was documented.

## Ongoing Legal and Legislative Action

**Ghislaine Maxwell**, serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, has offered to provide information in exchange for clemency. A federal court allowed a lawsuit against Bank of America to proceed in February, with plaintiffs alleging the bank facilitated Epstein's operations through financial services.

**New Mexico** launched its first full investigation into Epstein's Zorro Ranch on February 17. The property was purchased by the family of **Don Huffines**, a Texas GOP comptroller candidate, for $13.4 million.

Congressional hearings continue. Massie told reporters that Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors during testimony and said he lost confidence in the Attorney General over the files dispute.

The **Epstein Transparency Act**, signed into law in 2026, required the release of government records related to Epstein's case. The FBI began its review under the law, though lawmakers including **Rep. Mace** have since pushed for judicial term limits and additional transparency measures.

Independent platforms have emerged to make the released documents more accessible. **JeffTube**, launched in February, provides searchable access to DOJ files.

Former President **Bill Clinton** told the BBC in a February 17 interview that the Trump DOJ is engaged in a "cover-up" regarding the files. President Trump called for an end to the Epstein investigation on February 13, a position that has drawn criticism from members of his own party.

Additional congressional hearings on Epstein file transparency are scheduled through February. Lawmakers have issued subpoenas to **Les Wexner**, the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret, to testify on his Epstein contacts. Multiple universities have removed staff members who facilitated Epstein-connected admissions or donations.
