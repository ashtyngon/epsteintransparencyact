**Steve Bannon** maintained contact with **Jeffrey Epstein** for years after the financier's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to newly released text messages and emails in the DOJ's February file release. The messages show Bannon continued engaging with Epstein through at least 2019, months before Epstein's arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.

The communications document a relationship that extended beyond casual acquaintance. Bannon, who served as chief strategist to President Trump before becoming a MAGA media figure, told The New York Times the relationship was tactical—he sought to get Epstein to "open up" about his connections to powerful figures. The texts, however, reveal what the Times described as a "seemingly chummy relationship" that persisted despite Epstein's status as a registered sex offender.

Documents show the two men discussed politics, media strategy, and mutual contacts. In one exchange previously [reported on this site](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files), Bannon and Epstein discussed "taking down" Pope Francis, according to DOJ files released February 15.

## A Pattern of Elite Access

The Bannon-Epstein communications add to a mounting picture of how Epstein maintained elite connections long after his 2008 guilty plea. As documented in [prior reporting](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-invited-to-congressional-galas-years-after-arrest-docs-show), Epstein received invitations to Congressional galas years after his arrest. Other files show he maintained contact with figures including [Nobel Prize administrators](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-used-nobel-prize-access-to-lure-elite-network-files-show), [media executives](/news/2026-02-13-media-mogul-michael-ferro-canceled-last-minute-epstein-meeting-emails-reveal), and [university officials](/news/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama).

The relationship between Bannon and Epstein developed during a period when both men wielded significant influence in different spheres—Bannon in conservative media and politics, Epstein in finance and philanthropy circles. The exact timeline of their contact remains unclear, as the DOJ released files contain [heavy redactions](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows) that **Rep. Thomas Massie** and others in Congress have criticized.

## Britain's Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

Separately, **Transparency International UK** released analysis of emails between Epstein and **Peter Mandelson**, the British politician who [received a Congressional subpoena](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) to testify about his Epstein contacts. The anti-corruption organization's review focuses on what the communications reveal about gaps in UK lobbying regulations.

The Mandelson emails show Epstein sought to leverage political connections in Britain, according to Transparency International UK's February 16 analysis. Mandelson has previously stated he had limited contact with Epstein and was unaware of the extent of his criminal activity. The organization did not accuse Mandelson of wrongdoing but used the case to highlight weaknesses in British disclosure requirements for political figures' outside contacts.

UK authorities have established a [national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations connected to Epstein's UK activities. Britain's top prosecutor stated in February that ["nobody is above the law"](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) as police probe **Prince Andrew's** connections, which have come under renewed scrutiny after files showed [an aide advised Epstein to hide his conviction on visa forms](/news/2026-02-14-prince-andrew-s-aide-advised-epstein-to-hide-conviction-on-visa-form).

## Midwest Lawmakers Face Constituent Pressure

In Minnesota and Iowa, federal lawmakers are facing questions about whether they plan to review unredacted Epstein files, according to a February 16 report by KTTC Rochester. The article did not specify which lawmakers had been contacted or detail their responses.

Congressional access to unredacted files has become a flashpoint. **Attorney General Pam Bondi** told lawmakers she released ["all" available Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed) and provided a list of approximately [300 names](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release). Members of Congress, however, have accused the DOJ of [muddying the list with dead celebrities](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) and maintaining excessive redactions.

**Rep. Ro Khanna** stated the DOJ should ["stop protecting predators"](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) in a February 16 statement. **Rep. Nancy Mace** has [demanded unredacted co-conspirator files](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files). **Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** [criticized Trump's handling](/news/2026-02-16-mtg-criticizes-trump-s-epstein-files-handling-as-political-miscalculation) of the file release as a "political miscalculation."

Analysis by researchers found the Trump DOJ [released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows) in its possession, according to a study released February 16. The FBI has stated it maintains [thousands of files](/news/2026-02-16-fbi-holds-thousands-of-files-on-detroit-millionaire-s-island-operation) related to Epstein's operations. An expert warned that releasing raw files without proper review could [harm ongoing investigations](/news/2026-02-14-expert-warns-raw-epstein-file-release-could-harm-ongoing-investigations).

## International Response

**France** has [established a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review files for French nationals, and prosecutors there are [investigating a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) whose name appeared in the releases. **United Nations experts** [called for investigation](/news/2026-02-16-un-experts-call-for-investigation-into-epstein-files-warn-of-crimes-against-huma) into the files in February, warning of potential crimes against humanity.

The files have triggered [global resignations and investigations](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-files-trigger-global-resignations-new-investigations). Recent departures include [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files), [Dubai's ports chief](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), **Casey Wasserman** who [sold his sports marketing agency](/news/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-agency-after-epstein-files-expose-ties), and **Tom Pritzker** of the Hyatt hotel family who [stepped down](/news/2026-02-16-hyatt-heir-tom-pritzker-steps-down-over-epstein-contact-links) over contact links.

## Ongoing Legal and Legislative Action

**Ghislaine Maxwell**, serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, has [offered to reveal "truth"](/news/2026-02-15-ghislaine-maxwell-offers-to-reveal-truth-in-exchange-for-clemency) in exchange for clemency. A federal court [allowed a lawsuit against Bank of America to proceed](/news/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed) in February, with plaintiffs alleging the bank facilitated Epstein's trafficking operation through financial services.

**New Mexico** launched its [first full investigation](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) into Epstein's Zorro Ranch on February 17. The 7,500-acre property was purchased by the family of **Don Huffines**, a [Texas GOP comptroller candidate](/news/2026-02-16-trump-gop-candidate-s-family-bought-epstein-s-abuse-ranch-for-13-4m), for $13.4 million. Huffines' ownership of the former abuse site has become a [political liability](/news/2026-02-15-texas-gop-alarmed-over-comptroller-candidate-s-epstein-ranch-purchase) within his party.

Congressional hearings continue. Massie told reporters that Bondi [avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) during testimony and has stated he [lost confidence in the Attorney General](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over the files dispute.

The **Epstein Transparency Act**, [signed into law in February 2026](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), required the release of government records related to Epstein's case. The FBI [began its review](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the law, though lawmakers including **Rep. Mace** have since [pushed for judicial term limits](/news/2026-02-17-rep-mace-demands-full-epstein-files-transparency-pushes-judicial-term-limits) and greater transparency measures.

Independent platforms have emerged to make the released documents more accessible. **JeffTube**, launched in February, [provides searchable access](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse) to DOJ files. Searches for specific locations have yielded unexpected results—a [Staten Island search uncovered hundreds of hits](/news/2026-02-16-staten-island-search-uncovers-hundreds-of-hits-in-epstein-files) in the files.

Former President **Bill Clinton** told the BBC in a February 17 interview that the Trump DOJ is engaged in a ["cover-up"](/news/2026-02-17-clinton-accuses-trump-doj-of-epstein-files-cover-up-in-bbc-interview) regarding the files. President Trump himself [called for an end to the Epstein investigation](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) on February 13, a position that has drawn criticism from members of his own party.

Additional Congressional hearings on Epstein file transparency are scheduled through February. Lawmakers have issued subpoenas to **Les Wexner**, the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret, to [testify on his Epstein ties](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties). Multiple universities have [removed staff members](/news/2026-02-16-columbia-removes-staff-who-facilitated-epstein-linked-dental-admission) who facilitated Epstein-linked admissions or donations.
