A federal court has released a new batch of previously sealed documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The release includes hundreds of pages of deposition transcripts and legal filings that had been under seal.

The documents were released following legal challenges from media organizations seeking greater transparency in the case. The released materials include testimony from multiple witnesses and references to various individuals connected to Epstein.

Legal experts noted that the release represents a significant step toward transparency, though substantial portions of the record remain sealed pending ongoing review.
