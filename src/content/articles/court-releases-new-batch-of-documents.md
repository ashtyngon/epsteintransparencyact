The **U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York** has released a new batch of previously sealed documents from the **Giuffre v. Maxwell** civil case. The release includes hundreds of pages of deposition transcripts, legal filings, and exhibits that had been under seal since the case was settled in 2017.

The documents were released following legal challenges from media organizations — including the **Miami Herald**, the **New York Times**, and the **Associated Press** — who argued that public interest in the Epstein case outweighed privacy concerns cited by parties to the lawsuit. Judge **Loretta Preska** oversaw the unsealing process, which began in **January 2024** with the first major batch of names and testimony.

## What the Documents Show

The released materials include deposition testimony from **Ghislaine Maxwell**, who was convicted on **December 29, 2021** of sex trafficking and sentenced to **20 years** in federal prison. The transcripts contain references to prominent individuals in Epstein's social, financial, and political networks.

The documents also include flight logs, scheduling records, and correspondence that detail the operations of Epstein's trafficking network across multiple properties — his Manhattan townhouse at **9 East 71st Street** (transferred from **Les Wexner** for a reported $0), his Palm Beach estate, his ranch in New Mexico, and his private island **Little St. James** in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

## Ongoing Unsealing Process

Legal experts noted that the release represents a significant step toward transparency, though substantial portions of the record remain sealed pending ongoing review. Judge Preska has ordered a phased release process, with additional documents scheduled for disclosure in coming weeks.

The unsealing is separate from but complementary to the records release mandated by the **Epstein Transparency Act**, signed into law on **November 19, 2025**. While the Act covers federal agency records, the court unsealing covers civil litigation documents — together providing the most comprehensive public accounting of Epstein's activities to date.
