Several Democratic members of Congress have invited survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation to attend President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, according to 1430wcmy.com.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The invitations come as dozens of Democratic lawmakers plan to skip the speech in protest.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The report does not specify which Democratic members extended the invitations, how many survivors were invited, or identify the lawmakers planning to boycott the address.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Action on Epstein Files

The move to invite Epstein survivors represents the latest congressional action related to the case. In December 2024, Congress passed the Epstein Transparency Act with overwhelming bipartisan support, requiring the FBI to review and release documents related to Epstein's sex trafficking operation.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> President Trump signed the law in January 2026.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The legislation mandates that the FBI produce an unclassified report identifying documents that can be released to the public. The law allows limited exceptions for classified information and material that could compromise ongoing investigations.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Following passage of the act, the FBI began its review of Epstein-related records earlier this year.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The agency has since released multiple batches of documents, though lawmakers from both parties have criticized the releases as incomplete.

## Democrats Challenge Document Releases

Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) stated last week that the Department of Justice withheld FBI interviews with a woman who accused Trump in connection with the Epstein case.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Garcia has repeatedly demanded full transparency in document releases.

Other lawmakers have raised concerns about redactions in released files. [Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) has accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) in the document releases, while [Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has publicly criticized redactions](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) as insufficient.

The State of the Union address is the president's annual speech to a joint session of Congress, typically attended by members of the House and Senate, Supreme Court justices, Cabinet members, and invited guests. Members of Congress are permitted to invite guests to sit in designated gallery sections during the address.

Democratic boycotts of presidential State of the Union addresses have occurred sporadically in recent decades, typically as protests against specific policies or actions.

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 of sex trafficking and conspiracy charges related to the recruitment and abuse of minor girls. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.
