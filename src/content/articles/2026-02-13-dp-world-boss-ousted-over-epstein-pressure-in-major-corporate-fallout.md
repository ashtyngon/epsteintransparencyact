A second major executive has been forced out over Jeffrey Epstein connections, this time at one of the world's largest port operators.

Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, who led Dubai-based **DP World**, was removed from his position after what Reuters described as "pressure over Epstein." The logistics giant gave no public explanation for the departure, and the company has not disclosed what documents or communications triggered the move.

The ouster comes days after [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-epstein-links) when emails surfaced showing she called Epstein an "older brother" figure. Two executives gone in a week—both at companies that stayed silent about Epstein ties for years.

## What DP World Isn't Saying

DP World operates ports in over 40 countries and handles roughly 10% of global container traffic. It's majority-owned by the Dubai government. The company has not explained what tied Bin Sulayem to Epstein, whether it conducted an internal review, or what it knew and when.

That opacity is typical. Corporations have spent years avoiding specifics about Epstein relationships, even as the executive suite empties out.

## The Files Are Forcing Action

For years after Epstein's 2019 death, most people named in connection with him faced minimal consequences. The release of millions of previously sealed pages has changed that.

[Congressman Mike Collins named six men](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-on-house-floor) from the files on the House floor last week. [Congress subpoenaed billionaire Les Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about his financial entanglement with Epstein. The [New York Times launched a major investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into the trove.

Dubai acted faster than most American institutions. That's not a compliment to anyone.

## Accountability Without Transparency

Both resignations share a problem: the public still doesn't know what these executives did, what they knew, or when they knew it. Companies are jettisoning liability without providing answers.

Ruemmler's "older brother" emails became public. Bin Sulayem's communications have not. Goldman Sachs said nothing about whether it vetted its top lawyer's Epstein ties before hiring her. DP World hasn't said whether it's reviewing other executives' contacts.

The [Epstein Transparency Act is now law](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), and the [FBI is reviewing records](/articles/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review). More names will surface. The question is whether corporations will get ahead of the releases or keep waiting until they're forced to act.

Two executives out. Thousands more names in the files.
