Attorney General Pam Bondi released a list of approximately 300 individuals whose names appear in Jeffrey Epstein files, the New York Post reported.

The list includes Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris, according to Bondi's disclosure.

## Disclosure Under Pressure

The release follows weeks of congressional criticism over the Justice Department's handling of Epstein documents. Republican lawmakers including Thomas Massie and Nancy Mace have [accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) through redactions in previously released files.

Bondi had previously [defended the administration's file release as complete](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more) while facing questions about what the documents contain.

## What the List Shows

The disclosure does not specify the nature or context of each individual's appearance in the files. Previous Epstein document releases have included email contact lists, scheduling records, and correspondence spanning business, political, and entertainment contacts.

The files were released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which President Trump signed into law earlier this year. The FBI has been conducting a [review of Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the law's provisions.

## Ongoing Scrutiny

The Epstein files have [triggered resignations and investigations globally](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-files-trigger-global-resignations-new-investigations). Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's documented contacts with Epstein have become a [liability among GOP senators](/news/2026-02-15-gop-senators-view-lutnick-s-epstein-contacts-as-political-liability).

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called the administration's handling of the files a ["political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) last week.

Bondi has not indicated whether the Justice Department will pursue investigations based on the names in the files.
