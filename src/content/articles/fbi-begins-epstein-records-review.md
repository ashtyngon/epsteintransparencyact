The Federal Bureau of Investigation has begun its internal review of records related to Jeffrey Epstein, as required by the **Epstein Transparency Act** signed into law on **November 19, 2025**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The agency confirmed that it is identifying and cataloging relevant documents across its holdings, including files from FBI field offices in the **Southern District of New York**, **Palm Beach, Florida**, and the **U.S. Virgin Islands** — the three primary jurisdictions where Epstein faced investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Act requires federal agencies to complete initial records transfers to the National Archives within **180 days** of enactment, placing the deadline in mid-May 2026.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The FBI's review covers decades of investigative material, including surveillance records, witness interviews, financial transaction reports, and communications intercepts.

## Scope of the Review

The FBI's Epstein-related holdings are among the largest of any federal agency, according to Reuters.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Bureau investigated Epstein multiple times: a **2006 Palm Beach investigation** that led to a plea deal negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney **Alexander Acosta**, a **2019 Southern District of New York investigation** that resulted in federal sex trafficking charges, and intelligence-related assessments connected to Epstein's international activities.

The review process is expected to take several months, with initial batches of records potentially becoming available by spring 2026.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The FBI joins other federal agencies — including the **Department of Justice**, **CIA**, **IRS**, and **State Department** — in complying with the law's mandate to collect and prepare records for public release.

## Transparency Advocates Push for Speed

Transparency advocates have called for the process to move quickly, noting that public interest in the case remains strong. **Courtney Wild**, one of Epstein's earliest identified victims, stated that the FBI has "had these records for years" and that the review process should not serve as a delay tactic.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Act includes provisions for an independent review board to evaluate records that agencies seek to withhold, with a presumption of disclosure.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Any exemptions must be justified under specific legal criteria, not blanket national security or privacy claims.
