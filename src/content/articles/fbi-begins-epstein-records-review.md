The Federal Bureau of Investigation has begun its internal review of records related to Jeffrey Epstein, as required by the recently enacted Epstein Transparency Act. The agency confirmed that it is identifying and cataloging relevant documents across its holdings.

The review process is expected to take several months, with initial batches of records potentially becoming available later this year. The FBI joins other federal agencies in complying with the law's mandate to collect and prepare records for potential public release.

Transparency advocates have called for the process to move quickly, noting that public interest in the case remains strong.
