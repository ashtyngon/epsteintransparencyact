Paris police raided the Arab World Institute in connection with the Epstein investigation, Fox News reported Friday.

No additional details about the raid were immediately available. French authorities have not disclosed what prompted the search, what materials investigators sought, or whether the operation produced evidence relevant to ongoing probes.

The Arab World Institute, a cultural center and museum on the Seine River in Paris's 5th arrondissement, has operated since 1987 under a partnership between France and 22 Arab countries. The institute promotes Arab culture and hosts diplomatic events.

The raid marks the first publicly reported law enforcement action at a French cultural institution in connection with the Epstein case.

## France Pursues Multiple Epstein Probes

France [established a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) earlier this month following the release of documents under the Epstein Transparency Act. The DOJ released millions of pages of emails, flight logs, and financial records in February, naming dozens of international figures with ties to Epstein.

[French prosecutors launched an investigation into a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) last week, though officials have not publicly identified the individual under scrutiny.

French law allows prosecutors to pursue cases involving French nationals or crimes committed on French soil regardless of where initial charges originated. French law enforcement has worked separately from U.S. authorities on investigations stemming from the Epstein files.

## International Response Grows

The Paris raid comes as [global investigations into Epstein's international network expand](/news/2026-02-16-global-investigations-into-epstein-s-international-network-expand) across multiple continents. [UK police launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations. [British prosecutors announced that "nobody is above the law"](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) as they examine Prince Andrew's activities.

The Epstein Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law in January, required the Justice Department to release all Epstein-related files within 60 days. The FBI released documents in February, though [lawmakers have accused the DOJ of over-redacting names](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) and withholding evidence of potential criminal conduct.

[Attorney General Bondi has defended the release](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more) while [facing criticism from members of Congress](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) who say the department should unredact files that name living individuals with connections to Epstein's network.

Fox News did not provide additional reporting on the circumstances surrounding the Arab World Institute raid or the institute's connection to the broader investigation.
