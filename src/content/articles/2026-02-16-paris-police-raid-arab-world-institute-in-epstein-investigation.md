French police raided the headquarters of the Arab World Institute in Paris on Feb. 16 as part of a financial investigation into former Culture Minister **Jack Lang** and his ties to **Jeffrey Epstein**, Fox News and France 24 reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Officers searched Lang's office at the institute as well as his Paris apartment, seeking documents related to a preliminary inquiry opened Feb. 6 by the National Financial Prosecutor's Office into "laundering of aggravated tax fraud" against Lang and his daughter **Caroline Lang**, according to France 24.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The raid unfolded during a surreal scene: Lang, 86, was holding his own farewell ceremony at the institute after resigning from its presidency earlier in the month.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup><sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## The Epstein-Lang Connection

Lang's name appeared 673 times in correspondence with Epstein spanning 2012 to 2019, according to documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup><sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> The exchanges covered topics including a property transaction in Morocco, in which Lang reportedly told Epstein the asking price was 5.4 million euros "offshore," according to investigative outlet Mediapart.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

At the center of the financial probe is Prytanee LLC, an offshore company founded in 2016 in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Caroline Lang held 50 percent of shares in the entity, which held $1.4 million in its accounts and was described as a fund to support emerging French artists.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup><sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> She also appeared in a will Epstein signed two days before his death in August 2019, which promised her $5 million. Caroline Lang told France 2 she was unaware of the will and never received funds.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Both Langs have denied wrongdoing. Jack Lang said he met Epstein through filmmaker **Woody Allen** and Allen's partner **Soon-Yi Previn** approximately 15 years ago and was "completely shocked" upon learning of the financier's crimes.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Caroline Lang, a film producer, described Epstein as an "acquaintance" and called herself "incredibly naive," but insisted she received no financial benefit from the relationship.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Lang served as France's Minister of Culture from 1981 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1993 under President **Francois Mitterrand**. He had led the Arab World Institute since 2013. French President **Emmanuel Macron** and Prime Minister **Sebastien Lecornu** summoned Lang to the Foreign Affairs Ministry before he submitted his resignation on Feb. 8.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## Part of a Broader French Crackdown

The raid followed by two days France's decision to [establish a special team of magistrates to review Epstein files for French nationals](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals/).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> That team is coordinating with the national financial crimes unit and police to open investigations into suspected crimes by French citizens named in the Epstein documents.

[French prosecutors also opened an investigation into diplomat **Fabrice Aidan**](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe/), whose email correspondence with Epstein from 2010 to 2017 surfaced in the released files.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The prosecutor's office additionally received complaints against model recruiter **Daniel Siad** and conductor **Frederic Chaslin**.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## International Response

The Paris action came as [global investigations into Epstein's international network expanded](/news/2026-02-16-global-investigations-into-epstein-s-international-network-expand/) across multiple continents.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> [UK police launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations/) to investigate trafficking allegations connected to the files, and British prosecutors stated that "nobody is above the law" as they examine evidence related to **Prince Andrew**.

The [Epstein Transparency Act, signed Nov. 19, 2025](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law/), required the Justice Department to release all Epstein-related files within 60 days. Attorney General **Pam Bondi** announced that "all" files have been released consistent with the act, though [lawmakers have accused the DOJ of extensive redactions](/news/2026-02-18-doj-accused-of-flouting-epstein-transparency-act/) and withholding documents.

The Arab World Institute, a cultural center on the Seine in Paris's 5th arrondissement, has operated since 1987 as a partnership between France and 22 Arab League member states. A French diplomat has been named as Lang's replacement at the institution.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>
