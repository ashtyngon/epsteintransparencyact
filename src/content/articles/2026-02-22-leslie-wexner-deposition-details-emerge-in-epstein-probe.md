A deposition of **Leslie Wexner**, the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret and L Brands, was the focus of 10TV's "Face the State" program Sunday, according to the Columbus television station.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The program recapped Wexner's deposition related to the **Jeffrey Epstein investigation**, 10TV reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner has faced sustained scrutiny over his decades-long financial relationship with Epstein. The two maintained business ties from approximately 1987 until 2007, when they severed the relationship following Epstein's first conviction on solicitation charges in Florida.

## Business Relationship Details

During their business relationship, Wexner granted Epstein power of attorney over his finances, giving the financier broad control over his wealth and business decisions. Epstein acquired Wexner's Manhattan townhouse in a transaction that has drawn scrutiny from investigators and journalists examining how Epstein built his fortune.

[Wexner testified before Congress](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony) that he was unaware of Epstein's criminal conduct. He has stated through representatives that he ended their relationship after Epstein's 2008 conviction.

Epstein was arrested in 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges and died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner.

## Congressional Testimony

[Congress subpoenaed Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about his ties to Epstein as part of ongoing investigations into Epstein's network and activities. During that testimony, Wexner maintained that Epstein had deceived him about the nature of his activities.

[Epstein survivor Maria Farmer denounced Wexner's testimony](/news/2026-02-21-maria-farmer-denounces-wexner-s-house-deposition-as-abhorrent), calling it "abhorrent." Farmer has stated she was abused at Wexner's estate.

The billionaire stepped down as CEO of L Brands in 2020 amid continued scrutiny of his Epstein ties and criticism of workplace culture at Victoria's Secret. He remains a significant figure in Columbus, Ohio, where his company was headquartered and where he and his wife have made substantial philanthropic contributions to local institutions.

## Document Releases Continue

Multiple lawsuits filed by Epstein's alleged victims have sought testimony from individuals who had business or social relationships with the financier. Wexner's name has appeared in numerous court filings related to the case, though he has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2025, requires the FBI, CIA, and other federal agencies to declassify and release records related to Epstein's activities and associates. Depositions and other testimony from individuals connected to Epstein have become part of the expanding public record as civil litigation continues.

The "Face the State" segment aired on 10TV, the NBC affiliate serving the Columbus market where Wexner built his retail empire.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
