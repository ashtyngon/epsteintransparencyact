Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.) announced they will bring family members of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a deceased Epstein survivor, as their guests to President Trump's upcoming State of the Union address.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The two Democratic lawmakers made the announcement, identifying their guests as relatives of Giuffre, who accused Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Giuffre also publicly accused Prince Andrew of sexual abuse, allegations that led to a civil settlement in 2022 and contributed to his recent arrest in the United Kingdom.

Raskin represents Maryland's 8th Congressional District, while Subramanyam represents Virginia's 10th District.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## State of the Union Guest Tradition

State of the Union guests are selected by members of Congress to highlight policy priorities or draw attention to specific issues. The practice places individuals affected by matters lawmakers consider important in the House chamber during one of the year's most-watched political events.

The invitation comes after the [Epstein Transparency Act was signed into law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) in January, mandating release of FBI records related to Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The law passed both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support, and the [FBI has begun its review](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) of documents for public release.

## Giuffre's Role in Epstein Case

Giuffre was one of the most vocal survivors of Epstein's trafficking network. She provided extensive testimony about abuse she suffered and witnessed, and her civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew brought international attention to the case.

Prince Andrew was [arrested earlier this month](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-in-london-over-epstein-documents), and [UK authorities have widened their investigation](/news/2026-02-22-police-widen-prince-andrew-investigation-after-epstein-files-arrest) following document releases under the Transparency Act. Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has [called for a probe](/news/2026-02-22-gordon-brown-demands-probe-into-andrew-s-raf-base-epstein-meetings) into meetings between Andrew and Epstein at RAF bases.

Ghislaine Maxwell has [filed a legal challenge](/news/2026-02-22-maxwell-challenges-epstein-files-law-as-unconstitutional) arguing the Epstein Transparency Act is unconstitutional. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for sex trafficking and conspiracy charges related to her role in Epstein's criminal operation.

The White House has not yet announced a specific date for the State of the Union address, scheduled for early March.
