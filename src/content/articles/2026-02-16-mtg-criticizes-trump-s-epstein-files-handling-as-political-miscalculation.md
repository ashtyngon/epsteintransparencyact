Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene told fellow conservatives they sound like "cult fools" when defending the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, according to The Independent.

The Georgia congresswoman also warned Republicans about their approach to the case: "Good luck trying to get women to vote for you."

Greene specifically criticized conservatives who seek to discredit Epstein's victims. The comments place her at odds with Trump supporters over the administration's response to the files.

## Midterm Warning

Greene tied the Epstein issue to the 2026 midterm elections, warning that the Republican stance could cost the party women voters.

She [previously called Trump's handling of the Epstein documents](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) a "political miscalculation."

## GOP Divide Over File Releases

Multiple Republican lawmakers have clashed with the Justice Department over the Epstein file releases. Rep. Thomas Massie [lost confidence in Attorney General Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over the handling of the documents. Rep. Nancy Mace [accused DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release).

Attorney General Bondi has defended the releases as complete, [listing 300 names](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release) from the files. [Lawmakers disputed that claim](/news/2026-02-15-lawmakers-accuse-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-names-in-doj-letter), saying the DOJ obscured information.

The files have [triggered resignations and investigations globally](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-files-trigger-global-resignations-new-investigations), including the departures of [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) and sports agent [Casey Wasserman](/news/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-agency-after-epstein-files-expose-ties).
