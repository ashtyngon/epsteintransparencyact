Ghislaine Maxwell declined to testify before Congress last week but communicated through her legal team that she would provide information about Jeffrey Epstein if granted clemency, according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Maxwell, convicted of sex trafficking minors in connection with Epstein, made the offer through her attorneys rather than appearing herself. Legal experts quoted by The Guardian questioned her motivations for the proposal.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Offer

Maxwell communicated the offer while declining to provide testimony under oath. She is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for sex trafficking.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Her refusal to testify came as Congress has [subpoenaed multiple Epstein associates](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), including billionaire Les Wexner.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Lawmakers have also pressed the [Justice Department over redacted files](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) and [questioned Attorney General Bondi](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) about sealed documents.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup><sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act has led to the release of thousands of pages naming dozens of individuals who had contact with Epstein. The disclosures have prompted resignations and investigations in multiple countries.

Maxwell maintains her innocence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
