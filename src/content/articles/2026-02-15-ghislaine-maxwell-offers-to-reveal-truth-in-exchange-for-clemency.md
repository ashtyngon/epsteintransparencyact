Ghislaine Maxwell refused to testify before Congress last week but told lawmakers she would reveal the "truth" about Jeffrey Epstein — if they free her from prison first.

Maxwell, convicted of helping Epstein draw teenage girls into sexual abuse, made the offer through her legal team rather than appearing herself. Experts quoted by The Guardian questioned her motivations for the proposal.

## The Offer

Maxwell dangled information before Congress and the public while declining to provide testimony under oath. She is currently serving a federal prison sentence for sex trafficking.

Her refusal to testify came as Congress has [subpoenaed multiple Epstein associates](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), including billionaire Les Wexner. Lawmakers have also pressed the [Justice Department over redacted files](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) and [questioned Attorney General Bondi](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) about sealed documents.

The Epstein Transparency Act has led to the release of thousands of pages identifying [dozens of individuals](/articles/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) connected to Epstein. The disclosures have triggered [resignations](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) and [investigations in France](/articles/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe).

Maxwell maintains her innocence.
