Kathy Ruemmler, Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, has resigned after emails revealed close ties to Jeffrey Epstein. In a statement issued before her departure, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said Ruemmler "regrets ever knowing him."

The carefully worded statement offers no explanation for the relationship, no details about what she discussed with a convicted sex offender, and no accounting for why she maintained contact with him.

## The Non-Apology

"Regrets ever knowing him" is the kind of language corporations deploy when they're caught, not when they're coming clean. It acknowledges nothing except that the emails exist and that publicity is unwelcome. Goldman Sachs hasn't said whether it knew about Ruemmler's Epstein connection when it made her general counsel, one of the most powerful legal positions on Wall Street.

The bank also hasn't disclosed whether it reviewed her communications, investigated the nature of her relationship with Epstein, or took any action before the emails became public.

## Pattern of Forced Exits

Ruemmler's resignation follows a string of high-profile departures triggered by the Epstein files. [DP World's CEO was forced out earlier this week](/articles/dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails) after emails showed he called Epstein an "older brother" figure. [A billionaire CEO resigned](/articles/billionaire-ceo-resigns-after-epstein-connection-exposed) after his name surfaced in the documents. [College presidents and professors have been named](/articles/college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) as the files continue to expose institutional ties.

[Congressional Democrats have demanded full transparency](/articles/khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down), with Rep. Ro Khanna calling for the complete release of names still hidden by redactions. [A congressman recently named six individuals on the House floor](/articles/congressman-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-on-house-floor) whose identities had been shielded.

## What Goldman Won't Say

The emails show "close ties" between Ruemmler and Epstein, according to reports of the documents. Goldman Sachs hasn't defined what "close ties" means, what business Ruemmler conducted with Epstein, or whether any of those interactions occurred while she held positions of public trust.

The bank has not announced Ruemmler's replacement or indicated whether it plans to review other employees' potential Epstein connections.

Meanwhile, [the Trump administration faces accusations of covering up names through heavy redactions](/articles/trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions), while [the New York Times has launched a major investigation into millions of pages of Epstein files](/articles/nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files). More revelations appear inevitable. More resignations likely won't be.
