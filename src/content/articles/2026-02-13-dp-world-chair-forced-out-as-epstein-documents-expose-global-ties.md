DP World's chairman resigned Friday after documents revealed ties to Jeffrey Epstein, making him the second top executive at the Dubai-based ports operator to be forced out over connections to the convicted sex trafficker in less than a week.

The company has not publicly identified the chairman or disclosed what the documents contained. The resignation follows [CEO Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem's ouster](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails) just days earlier after emails showed correspondence with Epstein.

DP World operates more than 80 marine and inland terminals across six continents, including facilities at U.S. ports. The company now faces a leadership vacuum at its two highest positions simultaneously.

## Part of a Broader Wave

The DP World chairman's exit continues a pattern of high-profile departures triggered by the ongoing Epstein file releases. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-epstein-links) after emails surfaced showing he'd called Epstein an "older brother" figure. [Other executives across multiple industries](/articles/2026-02-13-billionaire-ceo-resigns-after-epstein-connection-exposed) have stepped down as documents expose previously hidden relationships.

The documents emerged from the release of Epstein-related materials under the transparency law signed earlier this year. But the [DOJ has been accused of covering up key information](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) through excessive redactions, drawing sharp criticism from members of Congress who've [pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi](/articles/2026-02-13-ag-questioned-on-epstein-files-release) for answers.

Rep. Ro Khanna has [demanded full disclosure](/articles/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down) of names in the files. "When major corporate leaders resign over Epstein ties, the public deserves to know the full extent of these relationships," Khanna said after an earlier resignation.

## What DP World Won't Say

DP World has offered no explanation for why its chairman resigned or what specifically appeared in the Epstein documents. The company's silence leaves open whether executives maintained ongoing contact with Epstein, received financial benefits from the relationship, or had knowledge of his criminal conduct.

The dual leadership crisis at a company managing critical port infrastructure across dozens of countries raises uncomfortable questions about vetting and oversight at the highest corporate levels. DP World's contracts with governments worldwide could face renewed scrutiny as more details emerge.

The company did not respond to requests for comment.
