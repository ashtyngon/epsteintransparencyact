Steve Bannon sent Jeffrey Epstein a message in June 2019 stating "Will take down [Pope] Francis," according to Department of Justice files released under the Epstein Transparency Act, as reported by The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The communication took place one month before Epstein's arrest on federal sex trafficking charges. The documents do not detail what actions Bannon planned or whether he pursued them.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Bannon served as chief strategist in the Trump White House for seven months in 2017. He previously chaired Trump's 2016 campaign and ran Breitbart News. By June 2019, he had been out of the administration for nearly two years but remained active in conservative political circles.

## Context

Pope Francis has faced opposition from some American conservative Catholics over his statements on immigration, climate change, and economic policy. The nature of Bannon's stated plans remains unclear from the released documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking minors. He died in his Manhattan jail cell the following month while awaiting trial. A medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.

The Vatican maintains diplomatic relations with the United States through the Holy See's embassy in Washington.
