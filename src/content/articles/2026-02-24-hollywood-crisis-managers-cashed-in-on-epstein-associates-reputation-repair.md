High-profile Hollywood crisis management firms solicited work from individuals connected to Jeffrey Epstein following his 2008 conviction, positioning themselves as reputation repair specialists, according to documents and interviews reported by The Hollywood Reporter.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

One publicist contacted a person connected to the case with a pitch stating: "I can help you turn your reputation around," according to communications reviewed by the outlet.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The outreach came after Epstein's guilty plea to state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida, which resulted in an 18-month jail sentence under a controversial non-prosecution agreement.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Hollywood Reporter's investigation found that Epstein associates became targets for an industry of reputation managers who pitched their services in the years after the conviction.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Sources described Epstein-related reputation management as a "cottage industry" among top-tier crisis communications specialists.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Crisis Management Became Lucrative Segment

Multiple crisis management professionals reached out to people in Epstein's orbit with offers to manage media coverage and public perception, The Hollywood Reporter found.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The firms involved included some of the entertainment industry's most established names in damage control and media strategy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The pitches came during a period when Epstein was attempting to rebuild his public image and business connections following his release from custody in 2009.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Epstein served 13 months of his sentence in a work-release program that allowed him to leave jail six days per week for 12 hours at a time to work from his Palm Beach office.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Hollywood Reporter reported that crisis management firms competed to represent individuals whose associations with the financier had become public liabilities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Some firms specialized in managing media narratives around sexual misconduct allegations and high-profile scandals.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The outlet's sources indicated that reputation managers presented themselves as intermediaries who could control damage in both traditional and social media.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The entertainment industry's crisis management sector charges retainers that can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for comprehensive reputation rehabilitation campaigns.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Firms Declined to Identify Clients

The investigation did not specify which individuals connected to Epstein hired these firms or what services were ultimately provided.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Hollywood Reporter did not identify specific crisis management firms by name, citing confidentiality concerns and the sensitivity of client relationships in the reputation management industry.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Several crisis management professionals acknowledged the pattern of outreach to Epstein associates but declined to name specific clients or detail the scope of work performed, according to The Hollywood Reporter.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The outlet's investigation comes as federal authorities continue to examine Epstein's network and contacts.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
