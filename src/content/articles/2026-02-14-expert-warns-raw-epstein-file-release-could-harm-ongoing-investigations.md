A legal expert warned that releasing Epstein files without proper review "can be counterproductive," according to RFI.

The comment directly challenges the approach taken under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which mandated release of FBI and DOJ records related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The law has resulted in [millions of files spreading across social media](/articles/2026-02-14-epstein-emails-spread-across-social-media-in-viral-leak) with minimal processing.

## Investigation Concerns

The expert's warning centers on potential harm to ongoing investigations from unfiltered document dumps. The [FBI has cited active investigations](/articles/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) as reason for maintaining redactions, though critics call this a stalling tactic.

[Attorney General Bondi faced congressional questioning](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) about DOJ resistance to full disclosure. She defended redactions on investigative and privacy grounds. The Trump administration has [called for ending the investigation entirely](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation), drawing [criticism from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene](/articles/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation).

## Competing Models

Other governments have adopted structured review processes. [France created a special team](/articles/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to examine files for French nationals before taking action. [UK police launched a task force](/articles/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations systematically.

Members of Congress have pushed for immediate full transparency. [Rep. Thomas Massie declared "I am not suicidal"](/articles/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) while demanding complete disclosure. [Rep. Ro Khanna called for naming all individuals](/articles/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down) in the files.

The raw document approach has produced high-profile resignations and [congressional subpoenas](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), but the expert's position suggests unvetted releases may compromise prosecutorial efforts.

[Courts continue to release new batches](/articles/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents) of Epstein-related documents while the debate over release methodology continues.
