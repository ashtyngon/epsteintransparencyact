The Department of Justice has released more than 3 million pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, The Times of India reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The files are available for public access online through government websites established to comply with transparency legislation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The document release follows the passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in January 2025.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The legislation mandated federal agencies to declassify and publicly release records related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Scope of the Release

The Times of India reports the files can be accessed through government websites.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The release includes records from multiple federal agencies, including the FBI and Department of Justice, that were required to review their holdings under the Epstein Transparency Act.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The FBI began its formal review process shortly after the law took effect in January 2025.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Congressional Response

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) stated publicly that the files reveal a criminal network "much bigger" than previously understood.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) alleged that the Department of Justice withheld certain FBI interview records involving a Trump accuser from the initial release.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Background on Transparency Act

The Epstein Transparency Act passed the House of Representatives with 418 votes in favor and zero opposed in January 2025, followed by Senate passage later that month.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The legislation required federal agencies to review and release their Epstein-related records within 90 to 180 days, depending on the agency.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Jeffrey Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida. He was arrested again in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges but died in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and conspiracy. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The 3 million-page release represents the federal government's effort to comply with statutory deadlines under the Epstein Transparency Act.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
