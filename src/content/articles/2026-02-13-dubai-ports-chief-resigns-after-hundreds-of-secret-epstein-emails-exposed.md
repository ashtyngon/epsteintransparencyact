The head of Dubai's massive ports operation has quit after newly released documents showed he was mentioned more than **4,700 times** in the Epstein files, according to CBS News.

**Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem's** departure from **DP World**—which operates ports across six continents and employs approximately 103,000 people—follows the exposure of extensive correspondence with the convicted sex trafficker, according to BBC News. The company offered only a brief statement citing "strategic realignment."

The content of the thousands of documented interactions between bin Sulayem and Epstein has not been disclosed.

## Another Executive Exit

Bin Sulayem joins a growing list of powerful figures forced out after their Epstein connections surfaced. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after the files named him. [Other billionaire executives have stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) under similar pressure.

Each resignation follows the same script: documents surface, the executive exits, and the institution stays silent about what the relationship actually entailed. Bin Sulayem's company offered no explanation for his departure and hasn't commented on the nature of his hundreds of emails with Epstein.

In each case, the public learns an executive communicated extensively with a convicted sex trafficker, followed by that person's departure. The substance of those communications has not been made public.

## What's Still Redacted

Rep. Ro Khanna put it bluntly after [another major Epstein associate stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down): "Every resignation raises the same question—what are they hiding, and who else is in those files?"

Attorney General Pam Bondi has refused demands for full document release, even as members of Congress publicly name individuals they say are being shielded by redactions.

The FBI has stated that redactions protect ongoing investigations and privacy. Transparency advocates have noted a disconnect between those justifications and the pattern of immediate resignations following document releases.

## The Transparency Gap

We know bin Sulayem sent hundreds of emails to Epstein. We don't know what they said, what business they might have conducted, or why a ports executive had such extensive contact with a financier whose client list and activities remain partially hidden behind government black ink.

The Epstein files have so far produced resignations without public explanations from the individuals involved. Large portions of the documents remain redacted.

Congress has already moved to depose Les Wexner, Epstein's closest known financial associate. Whether lawmakers will demand testimony from international figures like bin Sulayem remains unclear.
