**Maria Farmer**, an Epstein survivor, issued a statement Saturday denouncing billionaire retail mogul **Les Wexner's** recent congressional testimony as "abhorrent" after Wexner denied knowledge of convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein's** crimes during a deposition before the House.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Farmer referenced her **1996 court filing** in her statement, in which she accused Epstein of abusing her at Wexner's Ohio residence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Her characterization of Wexner's testimony directly challenges the billionaire's claims of ignorance about criminal activity that allegedly occurred at his own property.

## Wexner Denies Knowledge in House Deposition

Wexner, the founder of L Brands, appeared for a deposition before the House to answer questions about his relationship with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> During that testimony, the billionaire denied knowledge of Epstein's crimes, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The retail mogul's relationship with Epstein spanned decades. Epstein managed Wexner's fortune and held significant control over the billionaire's financial affairs during the 1980s and 1990s, making Wexner one of Epstein's most prominent clients and financial backers.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

[Wexner testified before Congress](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony) as part of an ongoing investigation into Epstein's network of associates and enablers.

## Farmer's 1996 Court Filing

Farmer's 1996 filing places her among the earliest known accusers to formally document allegations against Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> That filing predates Epstein's first criminal conviction by more than a decade and specifically identified Wexner's Ohio estate as a location where abuse occurred.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The survivor's statement Saturday directly responded to Wexner's congressional testimony, with Farmer calling it "abhorrent" that the billionaire would deny knowledge of criminal activity that she says took place at his residence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Farmer has been public about her allegations for years. Her early court filing established a connection between Epstein's crimes and properties owned by his wealthy benefactor, making Wexner's claims of ignorance particularly contentious for survivors who say abuse occurred at locations the billionaire owned and controlled.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Investigation Continues

Congress continues to investigate Epstein's network of associates. Wexner's deposition forms part of that inquiry, which has examined the financier's relationships with wealthy and powerful individuals who maintained ties with him over multiple decades.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The timing of Farmer's statement highlights ongoing tensions between survivors seeking accountability and individuals named in connection with Epstein who have denied knowledge of his crimes. Farmer's 1996 filing specifically alleged abuse at Wexner's Ohio property, making the location of the alleged abuse a key point of contention in evaluating the billionaire's testimony.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner has previously stated he severed ties with Epstein after learning of his crimes. The billionaire has maintained he was unaware of Epstein's abuse of young women and girls during their business relationship.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
