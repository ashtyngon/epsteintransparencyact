The UK government has stated that any inquiry into Prince Andrew's connections to Jeffrey Epstein falls under the jurisdiction of Parliament, not the executive branch, The Guardian reported Monday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Number 10 Downing Street made the statement when asked about potential investigations into the Duke of York's relationship with the convicted sex offender, according to the report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The response directs any formal inquiry efforts toward Members of Parliament rather than government ministers or agencies.

## Parliamentary vs. Executive Authority

The government's position places responsibility for any formal investigation with Parliament, which has the authority to establish select committees and conduct inquiries into matters of public interest.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> This designation separates executive branch involvement from potential legislative oversight of the royal family member's conduct.

MPs would have several mechanisms available to investigate Prince Andrew's Epstein connections, including establishing a special committee, calling witnesses to testify, and demanding documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Parliamentary select committees in the UK have broad powers to summon witnesses and examine documents as part of their oversight functions.

The statement does not indicate whether any members of Parliament have announced plans to pursue such an inquiry.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Andrew's Epstein Connection

Prince Andrew has faced persistent questions about his relationship with Epstein since the financier's arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019. The duke gave an interview to BBC Newsnight in November 2019, in which he addressed his friendship with Epstein and his visits to Epstein's properties. The interview was widely criticized and led to Andrew stepping back from royal duties.

Epstein died in August 2019 in federal custody while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The prince denied allegations of sexual misconduct and settled a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre in February 2022 without admitting liability. The terms of the settlement were not publicly disclosed. Despite the settlement, questions about the extent of his knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities and the nature of their relationship continue to surface.
