**Columbia University** removed officials who helped **Karyna Shuliak**, Jeffrey Epstein's last girlfriend, gain entry to its College of Dental Medicine through what the university described as an "irregular process" tied to fundraising solicitations. Shuliak, who moved to the U.S. from Belarus in 2010, was initially denied admission in February 2012 but was admitted as a transfer student just months later after Epstein and his associates intervened. Epstein paid **$631,000** in tuition on Shuliak's behalf, and the university identified roughly **$210,000** in related donations.

The disciplinary measures at Columbia mark the latest institutional response to the document release, which now spans multiple continents and has triggered investigations in at least five countries. In Texas, a **"Trump Republican"** candidate's family purchased Epstein's **New Mexico ranch** where abuse occurred, while newly released communications show **Steve Bannon** maintained contact with Epstein years after his 2008 conviction.

The documents continue to reveal how Epstein embedded himself in academic, political, and business networks even after his criminal history became public.

## Columbia Officials Face Discipline

Columbia University said individuals still affiliated with the university who were connected to the irregular admissions process have been removed from administrative and volunteer leadership positions. Among those identified is Manhattan dentist **Dr. Thomas Magnani**, a prominent fundraiser who was removed from admissions roles and other university affiliations.

Former dental college dean **Ira Lamster**, who left the university voluntarily in 2017, was not disciplined. Lamster said Epstein asked him about "someone who I believed to be in his employ who was a dental student in Belarus," and agreed to refer Shuliak to a faculty member in charge of admissions because the school was "pursuing a major gift" from Epstein. The university also announced it would donate **$105,000 each** to two nonprofits supporting survivors of sexual abuse and human trafficking. Shuliak, now 36, was the last person to speak to Epstein before his death in 2019 and was left **$100 million** in his estate.

The revelation adds Columbia to a growing list of universities facing scrutiny over Epstein connections. Earlier document releases [named college presidents and professors](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) who maintained contact with Epstein, while separate files showed [he pulled strings at the University of Alabama](/news/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama).

## Texas Candidate's Family Bought Abuse Site

The family of **Donald Huffines**, a former GOP Texas state senator now running for state comptroller, purchased Epstein's **Zorro Ranch** in New Mexico for **$13.4 million in 2023**, according to documents reviewed by the Santa Fe New Mexican and confirmed by a Huffines spokesperson.

The 7,500-acre property served as a location where Epstein trafficked and abused teenage girls and young women, according to court documents and victim testimony. Multiple survivors have described abuse that occurred at the remote ranch near Stanley, New Mexico.

Huffines, who describes himself as a "Trump Republican," has not publicly addressed the purchase. His spokesperson confirmed the transaction to local media but did not provide additional comment.

The Guardian reported that the property changed hands two years ago, well after Epstein's 2019 death and Maxwell's 2021 conviction on sex trafficking charges. Texas GOP officials have expressed concern about the purchase becoming a political liability in Huffines's comptroller race.

Earlier reporting showed Huffines [owned Epstein's Zorro Ranch](/news/2026-02-16-maga-candidate-don-huffines-owned-epstein-s-zorro-ranch), prompting alarm among Republican voters in the state. The purchase coincided with ongoing investigations into Epstein's network.

## Bannon Maintained Epstein Contact

**Steve Bannon** maintained a "seemingly chummy relationship" with Epstein that extended beyond a single 2018 interview, according to text messages and communications released by the Department of Justice. The messages show Bannon stayed in contact with the convicted sex offender during a period when Epstein sought to rehabilitate his public image.

According to the New York Times, the communications indicate Bannon and Epstein exchanged messages about various topics, including discussions about [taking down Pope Francis](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files). Bannon has said publicly that he maintained contact with Epstein "in the name of getting Mr. Epstein to open up," suggesting he was cultivating Epstein as a source.

The documents do not indicate Bannon had knowledge of or participated in any criminal activity. However, the messages show Bannon continued engaging with Epstein years after his 2008 guilty plea to soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Bannon currently hosts a podcast popular with MAGA supporters. He has not provided detailed public comment on the released communications beyond his earlier statement about attempting to get Epstein to share information.

## International Investigations Expand

At least five countries have launched or expanded investigations into Epstein's connections with their nationals, according to reporting by The Independent. **France**, the **United Kingdom**, and **India** have each taken formal investigative steps in response to the document release.

French prosecutors confirmed they are [investigating a diplomat named in the files](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe). France previously [set up a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals).

UK authorities established a [national task force for Epstein trafficking allegations](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations), with the country's top prosecutor stating ["nobody is above the law"](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) as police investigate **Prince Andrew**.

India confirmed an [Indian businessman, minister, and guru were named in the files](/news/2026-02-14-indian-businessman-minister-guru-named-in-epstein-files), prompting questions in the country's parliament.

The international scope reflects Epstein's documented travels and connections across multiple continents. Flight logs and email records show regular international travel, with contacts spanning diplomatic, business, and cultural sectors.

## UK Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

**Transparency International UK** issued an analysis of emails between **Peter Mandelson** and Epstein, questioning what they reveal about Britain's lobbying regulations. The organization, which focuses on corruption and transparency issues, examined the communications following [Congress's subpoena of Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe).

The organization's analysis focused on disclosure requirements and oversight mechanisms for individuals who maintain relationships with convicted criminals while holding or seeking public positions. Mandelson served as UK Business Secretary and European Trade Commissioner, and was recently appointed UK Ambassador to the United States.

The Transparency International report did not accuse Mandelson of wrongdoing but questioned whether existing systems adequately capture and disclose such relationships. Mandelson has stated he regrets his association with Epstein and that their contact was limited.

## Document Volume Comparison

The Epstein files release, while substantial, contains fewer documents than major financial leak investigations, according to an analysis by The Sunday Guardian. The publication compared the Epstein document trove to the **Panama Papers**, **Paradise Papers**, and **Pandora Papers** — all of which contained millions of financial documents.

The DOJ has released what it claims are all relevant Epstein files, though analysis showed the department [released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows) when measured against the full investigative record. Attorney General **Pam Bondi** has [defended the release as complete](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more), while lawmakers including **Rep. Nancy Mace** and **Rep. Thomas Massie** have accused the department of withholding documents.

The comparison highlights questions about document completeness that have dominated Congressional oversight hearings. Bondi provided a [list of 300 names](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release) from the files but faced criticism for [including dead celebrities](/news/2026-02-15-bondi-named-dead-celebrities-in-epstein-email-list), which lawmakers said ["mudded" the list](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities).

## Academic and Business Fallout

The Columbia discipline follows a pattern of institutional responses to Epstein connections. Multiple organizations have taken action against individuals named in the files:

**Goldman Sachs** saw its [top lawyer resign after being named](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files). Dubai's ports chief [resigned after hundreds of secret emails were exposed](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed). **Casey Wasserman** [sold his agency](/news/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-agency-after-epstein-files-expose-ties) and [exited as Olympic chief](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) after Maxwell emails became public.

Academic institutions have faced particular scrutiny. Documents revealed Epstein [used Nobel Prize access to lure his elite network](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-used-nobel-prize-access-to-lure-elite-network-files-show), with [Nobel chief Thorbjørn Jagland receiving gifts from Epstein](/news/2026-02-13-nobel-chief-jagland-got-gifts-from-epstein-emails-reveal).

**Leon Black**, the billionaire investor who paid Epstein $158 million for tax advice, saw [schools cancel photo day](/news/2026-02-15-leon-black-named-in-epstein-files-schools-cancel-photo-day) after his name appeared in files.

## Congressional Pressure Continues

Multiple lawmakers continue pressing for additional disclosures. Rep. Mace [demands unredacted co-conspirator files](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files). Rep. **Ro Khanna** stated Epstein's network ["knew enough to know better"](/news/2026-02-16-rep-khanna-epstein-s-network-knew-enough-to-know-better).

Massie, one of the most vocal critics of the DOJ's handling of the files, said Bondi [avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors at a hearing](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) and declared he has [lost confidence in the attorney general](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash). He previously stated ["I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted around the files.

Even some Trump allies have criticized the administration's handling. **Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** called the file handling a ["political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation).

Congress has issued subpoenas to multiple individuals, including [billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties). Wexner's political donations have drawn attention, with reporting showing [Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner](/news/2026-02-14-ohio-politicians-received-campaign-funds-from-wexner).

## Banking and Corporate Liability

A federal court [allowed a Bank of America Epstein trafficking lawsuit to proceed](/news/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed), opening potential corporate liability for institutions that maintained banking relationships with Epstein's enterprises.

The ruling could set precedent for other financial institutions. Documents show Epstein maintained relationships with major banks despite his conviction and registered sex offender status.

**Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's** Epstein ties have become a [GOP liability](/news/2026-02-15-commerce-secretary-lutnick-s-epstein-ties-become-gop-liability), with GOP senators viewing his contacts as a [political problem](/news/2026-02-15-gop-senators-view-lutnick-s-epstein-contacts-as-political-liability).

## Public Access and Documentation

A new platform called [JeffTube makes DOJ Epstein files easier to browse](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse), improving public access to the document trove. The files have [spread across social media in a viral leak](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-emails-spread-across-social-media-in-viral-leak).

The **New York Times** has [launched a major investigation into millions of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files), with reporters analyzing communications, flight logs, and financial records.

[Court releases continue](/news/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents), with new batches of documents emerging from ongoing civil litigation separate from the DOJ release.

Some experts have warned that [raw file release could harm ongoing investigations](/news/2026-02-14-expert-warns-raw-epstein-file-release-could-harm-ongoing-investigations), creating tension between transparency demands and prosecutorial considerations.

## Survivor Testimony

**Juliette Bryant**, an Epstein survivor, told media ["I thought I was going to die"](/news/2026-02-15-epstein-survivor-juliette-bryant-thought-i-was-going-to-die) in describing abuse. Her testimony came as survivors attended Congressional hearings on the file release.

**Ghislaine Maxwell**, currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, has [offered to reveal "truth" in exchange for clemency](/news/2026-02-15-ghislaine-maxwell-offers-to-reveal-truth-in-exchange-for-clemency). Federal prosecutors have not responded publicly to the offer.

The FBI holds [thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's secret island operation](/news/2026-02-14-fbi-holds-thousands-of-files-on-detroit-millionaire-s-secret-island-operation) connected to the Epstein network, according to reporting, though those files remain separate from the main DOJ release.

## Next Steps

Congressional hearings continue, with additional testimony scheduled from subpoenaed witnesses. Federal courts have multiple pending civil cases that could produce additional document releases through discovery.

International investigations in France, the UK, and India remain active, with prosecutors in those countries conducting interviews and reviewing evidence. The UK task force has indicated its probe will extend through 2026.

Bondi faces continued Congressional pressure to release additional files. The attorney general has stated all relevant documents have been disclosed, setting up a potential confrontation with lawmakers who dispute that claim.

State-level investigations continue in New York and Florida, where Epstein maintained residences and conducted business. Those probes operate independently of federal oversight.
