**Columbia University** removed officials who helped **Karyna Shuliak**, described by the New York Times as Jeffrey Epstein's last girlfriend, gain entry to its College of Dental Medicine through what the university described as an "irregular process" tied to fundraising solicitations, according to the Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Shuliak, who moved to the U.S. from Belarus in 2010, was initially denied admission in February 2012 but was admitted as a transfer student months later after Epstein and his associates intervened, according to the report. Epstein paid **$631,000** in tuition on Shuliak's behalf, and the university identified roughly **$210,000** in related donations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The disciplinary measures at Columbia are the latest institutional response to the document release, which now spans multiple continents and has prompted investigations in at least five countries. In Texas, a GOP candidate's family purchased Epstein's **New Mexico ranch** -- a property where, according to court documents and victim testimony, abuse occurred.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Separately, newly released communications show **Steve Bannon** was in contact with Epstein years after his 2008 conviction.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The documents show Epstein maintained contact with academic, political, and business figures after his criminal history became public.

## Columbia Officials Face Discipline

Columbia University said individuals still affiliated with the university who were connected to the irregular admissions process have been removed from administrative and volunteer leadership positions, according to the Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Among those identified is Manhattan dentist **Dr. Thomas Magnani**, a fundraiser who was removed from admissions roles and other university affiliations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Former dental college dean **Ira Lamster**, who left the university voluntarily in 2017, was not disciplined. Lamster told the Times that Epstein asked him about "someone who I believed to be in his employ who was a dental student in Belarus," and that he agreed to refer Shuliak to a faculty member in charge of admissions because the school was "pursuing a major gift" from Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The university also announced it would donate **$105,000 each** to two nonprofits supporting survivors of sexual abuse and human trafficking. Shuliak, now 36, was the last person to speak to Epstein before his death in 2019 and was left **$100 million** in his estate, according to the Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Columbia joins other universities that have faced scrutiny over Epstein connections. Earlier document releases [named college presidents and professors](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) who had contact with Epstein, while separate files documented [contacts at the University of Alabama](/news/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama).<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup><sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## Texas Candidate's Family Purchased Epstein Property

The family of **Donald Huffines**, a former GOP Texas state senator now running for state comptroller, purchased Epstein's **Zorro Ranch** in New Mexico for **$13.4 million in 2023**, according to documents reviewed by the Santa Fe New Mexican and confirmed by a Huffines spokesperson.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The 7,500-acre property was described in court documents and victim testimony as a location where Epstein trafficked and abused teenage girls and young women. Multiple survivors described abuse that occurred at the remote ranch near Stanley, New Mexico.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Huffines, who describes himself as a "Trump Republican," has not publicly addressed the purchase. His spokesperson confirmed the transaction to local media but did not provide additional comment.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The Guardian reported that the property changed hands two years ago, after Epstein's 2019 death and Maxwell's 2021 conviction on sex trafficking charges. Some Texas GOP officials have expressed concern about the purchase becoming a political issue in Huffines's comptroller race.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Earlier reporting documented that Huffines [owned Epstein's Zorro Ranch](/news/2026-02-16-trump-gop-candidate-s-family-bought-epstein-s-abuse-ranch-for-13-4m).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Bannon-Epstein Communications

**Steve Bannon** was in contact with Epstein beyond a single 2018 interview, according to text messages and communications released by the Department of Justice.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The messages document Bannon's contact with the convicted sex offender during a period when Epstein was seeking to rehabilitate his public image.

According to the New York Times, the communications show Bannon and Epstein exchanged messages about various topics, including messages about Pope Francis.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Bannon has said publicly that he maintained contact with Epstein "in the name of getting Mr. Epstein to open up," describing his intent as cultivating Epstein as a source.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The documents do not indicate Bannon had knowledge of or participated in any criminal activity. The messages show Bannon continued communicating with Epstein years after his 2008 guilty plea to soliciting a minor.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Bannon currently hosts a podcast. He has not provided detailed public comment on the released communications beyond his earlier statement about attempting to get Epstein to share information.

## International Investigations Expand

At least five countries have launched or expanded investigations into Epstein's connections with their nationals, according to The Independent.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> **France**, the **United Kingdom**, and **India** have each taken formal investigative steps in response to the document release.

French prosecutors confirmed they are examining complaints related to a diplomat named in the files. France previously set up a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

UK authorities established a national task force for Epstein trafficking allegations, with the country's top prosecutor stating "nobody is above the law" as police examine allegations involving **Prince Andrew**.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

India confirmed an Indian businessman, minister, and guru were named in the files, prompting questions in the country's parliament.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Flight logs and email records document international travel and contacts spanning diplomatic, business, and cultural sectors.

## UK Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

**Transparency International UK** issued an analysis of emails between **Peter Mandelson** and Epstein, questioning what they reveal about Britain's lobbying regulations. The organization, which focuses on corruption and transparency issues, examined the communications following Congress's subpoena of Mandelson.

The organization's analysis focused on disclosure requirements and oversight mechanisms for individuals who maintain relationships with convicted criminals while holding or seeking public positions. Mandelson served as UK Business Secretary and European Trade Commissioner, and was recently appointed UK Ambassador to the United States.

The Transparency International report did not accuse Mandelson of wrongdoing but questioned whether existing systems adequately capture and disclose such relationships. Mandelson has stated he regrets his association with Epstein and that their contact was limited.

## Document Volume Comparison

The Epstein files release, while substantial, contains fewer documents than major financial leak investigations, according to an analysis by The Sunday Guardian. The publication compared the Epstein documents to the **Panama Papers**, **Paradise Papers**, and **Pandora Papers**, all of which contained millions of financial documents.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

The DOJ has stated it released all relevant Epstein files, though analysis by The Sunday Guardian indicated the department released approximately 2% of Epstein files when measured against the full investigative record.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> Attorney General **Pam Bondi** has defended the release as complete, while lawmakers including **Rep. Nancy Mace** and **Rep. Thomas Massie** have said the department is withholding documents.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

Bondi provided a list of 300 names from the files but faced criticism for including deceased celebrities, which lawmakers said undermined the list's credibility.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

## Academic and Business Developments

The Columbia discipline follows other institutional responses to Epstein connections. Multiple organizations have taken action regarding individuals named in the files:

**Goldman Sachs'** top lawyer resigned after being named. Dubai's ports chief stepped down after hundreds of emails were made public. **Casey Wasserman** sold his agency and left his role as Olympic chief after emails with Maxwell were released.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>

Academic institutions have faced scrutiny. Documents showed Nobel chief Thorbjorn Jagland received gifts from Epstein, according to reporting on the files.

**Leon Black**, the billionaire investor who, according to public disclosures, paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning advice, saw schools cancel photo sessions with his photography company after his name appeared in files.<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>

## Congressional Pressure Continues

Multiple lawmakers continue pressing for additional disclosures. Rep. Mace has called for unredacted co-conspirator files. Rep. **Ro Khanna** said Epstein's network "knew enough to know better."<sup>[10](#ref-10)</sup>

Massie, a vocal critic of the DOJ's handling of the files, said Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors at a hearing and stated he has lost confidence in the attorney general.<sup>[11](#ref-11)</sup> He previously stated "I am not suicidal" as pressure mounted around the files.<sup>[12](#ref-12)</sup>

**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** called the file handling a "political miscalculation."<sup>[13](#ref-13)</sup>

Congress has issued subpoenas to multiple individuals, including billionaire Les Wexner. Wexner's political donations have drawn attention, with reporting showing Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner.<sup>[14](#ref-14)</sup>

## Banking and Corporate Litigation

A federal court allowed a Bank of America Epstein trafficking lawsuit to proceed, which could open corporate liability questions for institutions that maintained banking relationships with Epstein's enterprises.

The ruling could affect other financial institutions. Documents show Epstein maintained relationships with major banks despite his conviction and registered sex offender status.

Republican senators have privately expressed concern about **Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's** documented Epstein contacts, viewing them as a potential political problem, according to The Hill.<sup>[15](#ref-15)</sup>

## Public Access and Documentation

A platform called JeffTube has been created to make DOJ Epstein files easier to browse.

The **New York Times** has assigned reporters to analyze the Epstein files, including communications, flight logs, and financial records.<sup>[16](#ref-16)</sup>

Court releases continue, with new batches of documents emerging from ongoing civil litigation separate from the DOJ release.

Some legal experts have said that releasing unredacted files could affect ongoing investigations, creating tension between transparency demands and prosecutorial considerations.

## Survivor Testimony

**Juliette Bryant**, who has said she was trafficked by Epstein, told The Independent she thought she was "going to die" during an alleged assault.<sup>[17](#ref-17)</sup> Survivors attended Congressional hearings on the file release.

**Ghislaine Maxwell**, currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, offered through her legal team to provide information in exchange for clemency, according to The Guardian.<sup>[18](#ref-18)</sup> Federal prosecutors have not responded publicly to the offer.

The FBI holds thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's alleged island operation described by reporting as connected to the Epstein network, though those files remain separate from the main DOJ release.

## Next Steps

Congressional hearings continue, with additional testimony scheduled from subpoenaed witnesses. Federal courts have multiple pending civil cases that could produce additional document releases through discovery.

International investigations in France, the UK, and India remain active, with prosecutors in those countries conducting interviews and reviewing evidence. The UK task force has indicated its probe will extend through 2026.

Bondi faces continued Congressional pressure to release additional files. The attorney general has stated all relevant documents have been disclosed, a claim disputed by multiple lawmakers.

State-level investigations continue in New York and Florida, where Epstein maintained residences and conducted business. Those probes operate independently of federal oversight.
