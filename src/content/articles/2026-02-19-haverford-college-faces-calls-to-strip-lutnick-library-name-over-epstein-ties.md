Students and alumni at Haverford College are calling for the removal of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's name from the school's library following revelations about his communications with Jeffrey Epstein years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for procuring a child for prostitution.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Lutnick, a 1983 Haverford graduate and the suburban Philadelphia school's largest single donor, stated in a 2025 podcast interview that he had cut ties with Epstein in 2005—three years before Epstein's conviction in a Florida state court.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

However, recently released Justice Department documents indicate that Lutnick and members of his family had lunch with Epstein on a boat at Epstein's Caribbean island in 2012, seven years after the date Lutnick claimed to have severed contact and four years after Epstein's criminal conviction.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## College President Addresses Controversy

Haverford College President Wendy Raymond wrote a message to faculty, students and alumni on Wednesday addressing the controversy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Raymond wrote that a growing number of community members have expressed their dismay over the revelations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
