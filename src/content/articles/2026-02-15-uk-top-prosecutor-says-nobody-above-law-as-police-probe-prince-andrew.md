Thames Valley Police are in discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service over allegations of misconduct in public office against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince.

The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions said "nobody is above the law" and expressed confidence that police would examine any evidence of potential misconduct. The statement comes amid growing pressure on British authorities to fully investigate Andrew's links with Jeffrey Epstein.

## Active Police Consultation

Thames Valley Police confirmed earlier this week they had entered discussions with prosecutors regarding the allegations. The force has not specified the nature of the alleged misconduct or provided a timeline for its review.

Andrew has faced scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein for years. He settled a civil lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, making no admission of liability.

## Broader UK Investigation

British authorities [established a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to coordinate investigations into Epstein-related trafficking allegations across multiple jurisdictions. The task force is reviewing files documenting contact between Epstein's network and UK-based individuals.

[Emails released in recent document dumps](/news/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface) contradicted several claims Andrew made during his 2019 BBC interview, showing planning for meetings and events he had characterized differently in public statements.

The Director of Public Prosecutions provided no timeline for when investigators might complete their evidence review or whether the Thames Valley inquiry could result in charges.

France has launched its own prosecutorial review of French nationals named in the Epstein files, [establishing a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to examine the documents for potential criminal conduct.
