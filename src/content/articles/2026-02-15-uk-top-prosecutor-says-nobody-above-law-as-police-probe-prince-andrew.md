Thames Valley Police are consulting the Crown Prosecution Service over allegations of misconduct in public office against **Prince Andrew**, as the United Kingdom's top prosecutor declared that "nobody is above the law," according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Stephen Parkinson**, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said he had "total confidence" in detectives examining the matter and insisted they would be able to conduct their investigation "independently."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

"It's my job to enforce the law and I do so without fear or favour, and that is unaffected by the status of the individual concerned," Parkinson said.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## The Allegations

The investigation centers on Andrew's conduct during his decade as the United Kingdom's special trade envoy, a taxpayer-funded position he held from 2001 to 2011. Documents released as part of the Epstein files appear to show Andrew forwarded U.K. government documents and commercial information to **Jeffrey Epstein** during that period.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

One file suggests the former Duke of York brought a close confidant of Epstein on an official overseas trip in 2010.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The potential charge of misconduct in public office applies to individuals who abuse positions of public trust.

Andrew settled a civil lawsuit with **Virginia Giuffre** in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, making no admission of liability. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein trafficked her to Andrew when she was 17. Andrew has denied all accusations of wrongdoing.

## Police and Parliamentary Pressure

Thames Valley Police, the force with jurisdiction over Andrew's residence at Royal Lodge in Windsor, confirmed it had entered discussions with prosecutors. The chief constable said all allegations of misconduct would be considered "carefully and thoroughly."<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Buckingham Palace released a statement saying King Charles stands "ready to support" the police investigation.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

A growing number of members of Parliament have called for Andrew to face questions from both police and Parliament. Labour MP **Sarah Owen**, chair of the women and equalities committee, and her colleague **Rachael Maskell** have pressed for a formal inquiry.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Maskell added that Andrew should be stripped of his succession rights to the throne and his role as a counsellor of state.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## Broader UK Investigation

British authorities [established a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to coordinate Epstein-related trafficking investigations across multiple jurisdictions.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The task force is reviewing files documenting contact between Epstein's network and U.K.-based individuals.

[Emails released in recent document batches](/news/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface) appeared to contradict several claims Andrew made during his 2019 BBC interview, in which he said he had no recollection of meeting Giuffre and described his relationship with Epstein as limited.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Parkinson provided no timeline for when investigators might complete their evidence review or whether the Thames Valley inquiry could result in charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## International Investigations

France has launched its own prosecutorial review of French nationals named in the Epstein files, [establishing a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to examine the documents for potential criminal conduct.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The parallel investigations mark the broadest international law enforcement response to the Epstein file releases to date.
