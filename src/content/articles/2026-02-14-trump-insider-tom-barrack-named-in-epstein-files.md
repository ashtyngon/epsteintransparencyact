**Tom Barrack**, a 78-year-old California-born billionaire and founder of **Colony Capital** (now **DigitalBridge Group**), maintained regular, close contact with **Jeffrey Epstein** for years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor, according to a CBS News analysis of more than 100 texts and email exchanges found in newly released Department of Justice files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Barrack, who chaired President **Donald Trump**'s 2017 inaugural committee and now serves as U.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, is among the highest-ranking Trump associates named in the documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## What the Files Show

The contact between Barrack and Epstein continued well after Epstein's release from Palm Beach County jail following his 2008 guilty plea. In September 2009, months after that release, Barrack wrote to Epstein: "Thinking about u, hope u r good and life is calm again," according to CBS News. That message began what the network described as an extended period of regular communication.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Over the following years, the documents show Epstein facilitating introductions between Barrack and prominent figures, including **Palantir** CEO **Peter Thiel**, former Israeli Prime Minister **Ehud Barak** and **Vitaly Churkin**, then Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

At times, Epstein appeared to regard Barrack as a potential conduit for passing information to Trump, though the available records show communication going in only one direction. There is no indication Epstein's messages were relayed to the president or that Trump communicated to Epstein through Barrack.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The files also show that the day after a scheduled lunch meeting involving Barrack, Epstein, Barak and Churkin, Epstein purchased approximately $1 million in stock in Colony Capital, Barrack's publicly traded real estate firm, which managed more than $60 billion in assets.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Epstein repeatedly encouraged Barrack to move their conversations to encrypted messaging apps, including Signal, the records of which were not included in the government files release.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

There is no evidence to suggest Barrack participated in or had knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct by Epstein, CBS News reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Background

Author **Michael Wolff** described Trump, Barrack and Epstein as "a 1980s and '90s set of nightlife Musketeers" in the book "Fire and Fury."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Barrack raised more than $100 million for the 2017 inaugural committee and maintained close advisory ties with the president.

Barrack was indicted in July 2021 on federal charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the United Arab Emirates and lying to the FBI. A jury acquitted him on all counts in November 2022. The Epstein file references are unrelated to that case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Political Fallout

[Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation/) on Feb. 13, stating that continued scrutiny served no public purpose. [Attorney General **Pam Bondi** has defended redactions](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release/) in files released to date, citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Several executives have resigned after appearing in released documents, including [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files/) and the [chairman of DP World](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed/).

CBS News said it reached out to Barrack, Trump, Thiel, Barak and businesswoman **Nicole Junkermann** for comment. None had responded as of publication.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
