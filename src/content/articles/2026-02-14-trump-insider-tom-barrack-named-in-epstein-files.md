Tom Barrack, a top U.S. diplomat and longtime friend of President Trump, networked and socialized with Jeffrey Epstein for years, CBS News reported after reviewing files.

CBS News did not specify when the contacts occurred, how frequently Barrack and Epstein met, or the nature of their interactions beyond networking and social events.

## Limited Disclosure

The network's report provided no details about whether the relationship continued after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, or whether Barrack had business dealings with Epstein.

CBS News also did not indicate which files contained references to Barrack or whether the documents were part of the materials released under the Epstein Transparency Act.

## Trump Connection

Barrack's decades-long friendship with Trump places him among several associates and appointees whose names have surfaced in Epstein-related documents. 

[Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) in a February 13 statement, arguing that continued scrutiny served no public purpose.

[Attorney General Pam Bondi has defended redactions](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) in files released to date, citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.

Several executives have resigned after appearing in released documents, including [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) and the [chairman of DP World](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties).
