**Tom Barrack**, founder of **Colony Capital** (now **DigitalBridge Group**) and chairman of President Trump's **2017 inaugural committee**, networked and socialized with Jeffrey Epstein for years, CBS News reported after reviewing files released under the Epstein Transparency Act.

Barrack, who served as **U.S. special envoy to the Middle East**, is among the highest-ranking Trump associates named in the documents. CBS News reported on contacts between Barrack and Epstein but did not specify the exact timeframe, frequency, or nature of their interactions beyond networking and social events.

## What the Files Show

The report did not detail whether the relationship continued after Epstein's **2008 conviction** for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Palm Beach, Florida, or whether Barrack had direct business dealings with Epstein. Barrack's real estate empire — Colony Capital managed over **$60 billion in assets** — operated in some of the same financial circles as Epstein.

Barrack was previously **indicted in July 2021** on federal charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the United Arab Emirates and lying to the FBI. He was **acquitted on all counts** in November 2022. The Epstein file references are unrelated to that case.

## Trump Connection

Barrack's decades-long friendship with Trump places him among several associates and appointees whose names have surfaced in Epstein-related documents. Barrack raised over **$100 million** for the 2017 inaugural committee and maintained close advisory relationships with the president.

[Trump called for ending the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) in a February 13 statement, arguing that continued scrutiny served no public purpose.

[Attorney General Pam Bondi has defended redactions](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) in files released to date, citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.

Several executives have resigned after appearing in released documents, including [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) and the [chairman of DP World](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties).
