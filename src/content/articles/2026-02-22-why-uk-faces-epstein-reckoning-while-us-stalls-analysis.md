**Arwa Mahdawi**, a Guardian columnist, published an opinion piece drawing attention to a stark divide: British authorities are pursuing criminal action against prominent figures connected to Jeffrey Epstein, while American officials have taken comparatively little action against U.S. citizens documented in Epstein's network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The column, titled "Prominent Brits are facing a reckoning over Epstein. In the US, not so much," comes as Prince Andrew faces [an expanded criminal investigation and continued police searches of his residence](/news/2026-02-22-police-widen-prince-andrew-investigation-after-epstein-files-arrest) following his recent arrest.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## UK Pursues Criminal Cases

Andrew's arrest represents the most significant criminal action against a prominent Epstein associate in the United Kingdom since the financier's 2019 death. British authorities have opened multiple probes, and members of Parliament have called for [a treason investigation into the Duke of York](/news/2026-02-22-uk-mp-seeks-treason-probe-into-prince-andrew-over-epstein).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Metropolitan Police revealed that officers assigned to protect Andrew were also instructed to provide security for Epstein's London residence, according to emails disclosed in recent document releases. A UK minister declined to rule out a judge-led public inquiry into Andrew's relationship with Epstein when questioned by reporters.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Limited U.S. Action

The Guardian column's observation of American inaction stands despite passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in late 2024, which mandated government document releases related to Epstein. The FBI conducted a review under the law, but federal prosecutors have not announced criminal investigations targeting prominent American figures in Epstein's network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), a sponsor of the transparency legislation, recently called the Epstein files "true evil" at a public event. Congressional members have criticized the scope of document releases, but no major prosecutions of American associates have resulted from the disclosures.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Multiple document releases have implicated both British and American individuals. Recent disclosures included details of Epstein's attempts to cultivate relationships with American academics and internal conflicts at a law firm that helped secure Epstein's 2008 plea deal. None of those revelations led to criminal charges or professional sanctions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Investigations Remain Narrow

The New Mexico Department of Justice opened an investigation into burial claims at Epstein's Zorro Ranch, representing one of few active U.S. law enforcement inquiries into Epstein-related matters. That probe focuses on a specific property rather than the broader network of American associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein victim advocate Maria Farmer publicly criticized testimony by billionaire Leslie Wexner following her abuse at Wexner's Ohio estate. Wexner has not faced criminal charges related to Epstein despite extensive documented connections between the two men.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

American law enforcement response has largely consisted of document releases and civil settlements. Courts released multiple batches of Epstein-related documents this year, adding thousands of pages to the public record of the financier's connections. Federal prosecutors have not announced charges against individuals named in those files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Mahdawi's column in The Guardian reflects growing public scrutiny of why British authorities have pursued criminal investigations while American officials have not, despite extensive documentation showing Epstein's operations were primarily based in the United States and involved numerous American associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
