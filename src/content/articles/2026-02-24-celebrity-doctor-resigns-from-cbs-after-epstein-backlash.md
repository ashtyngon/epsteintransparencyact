A celebrity doctor resigned from a position at CBS following backlash over revelations in newly released court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, AOL reported on February 24, 2026<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

The report provided no details about the specific individual, the nature of their role at CBS, or the content of the Epstein-related documents that prompted the departure<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

The resignation adds to a growing list of professional consequences for individuals whose names have appeared in court filings connected to Epstein's criminal case and civil litigation. Multiple batches of unsealed documents released in recent months have identified associates, acquaintances, and others who had contact with Epstein or his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.

## Recent Pattern of Resignations

Earlier in February 2026, health and longevity expert Peter Attia [stepped down from his position at CBS](/news/2026-02-24-health-guru-peter-attia-steps-down-after-epstein-correspondence-revealed) after correspondence with Epstein was revealed in unsealed materials<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. 

The acceleration in document releases follows passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, which became law in 2024. The federal legislation requires agencies to review and disclose records related to Epstein's case and associates. The FBI [began its review process](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the statute, which was [signed into law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) after unanimous passage in Congress.

CBS, a major broadcast network owned by Paramount Global, employs medical contributors and health experts across its news and talk show programming<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The network has not been previously identified as a focus of Epstein-related scrutiny.

## Document Release Context

Court documents unsealed in Maxwell's criminal case and related civil litigation have identified hundreds of individuals who had varying degrees of contact with Epstein's operation. The files have named prominent figures from business, science, politics, and entertainment sectors.

Inclusion in the files does not indicate criminal wrongdoing. However, some individuals named have faced professional repercussions, resignations, or calls for investigation based on the nature and extent of their documented relationships with Epstein.

Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida, serving 13 months under a controversial plea agreement. He was arrested again in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges but died in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.

Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges including sex trafficking of minors. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Documents from her case continue to be unsealed through court proceedings and federal transparency requirements.

The latest resignation reported by AOL reflects ongoing fallout from the document releases, though the limited details in the report make it unclear whether this represents a new development or additional reporting on a previously disclosed departure<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.
