Rep. Nancy Mace accused the Department of Justice of excluding names from the Epstein files after the agency sent a letter to Congress declaring its document release complete.

"They're missing names," the South Carolina Republican said in response to the DOJ letter about completing the Epstein files release.

## Growing Republican Pressure

Mace's accusation adds to mounting criticism from congressional Republicans over the handling of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Rep. Thomas Massie has [repeatedly challenged](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) Attorney General Pam Bondi over file redactions and [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene [called the Trump administration's file handling](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) a "political miscalculation."

Rep. Ro Khanna [demanded full transparency](/news/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down) after high-profile resignations linked to the files. One lawmaker [publicly named six men](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) allegedly hidden in the files despite the transparency law.

## Redaction Disputes

The Justice Department has [maintained that redactions protect ongoing investigations](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) and privacy interests. Legal experts [warned that releasing unredacted materials](/news/2026-02-14-expert-warns-raw-epstein-file-release-could-harm-ongoing-investigations) could damage pending prosecutions.

Attorney General Bondi was [grilled during congressional testimony](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) about why the department resists full document release. The administration also faced accusations of a [cover-up over redactions](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions).

## Transparency Act Implementation

Congress passed the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) requiring federal agencies to review and release documents related to Epstein's criminal activities and associations. The FBI [began its review](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) after the law took effect.

Multiple document batches have been released, naming dozens of individuals who had contact with Epstein. [Courts have also released](/news/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents) separate batches of Epstein-related materials.
