Rep. Nancy Mace accused the Department of Justice of excluding names from the Epstein files after the agency sent a letter to Congress declaring its document release complete, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"They're missing names," the South Carolina Republican said in response to the DOJ letter about completing the Epstein files release.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Criticism

Mace's statement adds to criticism from congressional Republicans over the handling of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Rep. Thomas Massie has [repeatedly challenged](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) Attorney General Pam Bondi over file redactions and [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene [called the Trump administration's file handling](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) a "political miscalculation."<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Rep. Ro Khanna called for full transparency after high-profile departures connected to the files.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> One lawmaker publicly named six men whose identities remained redacted despite the transparency law.

## Redaction Disputes

The Justice Department has maintained that redactions protect ongoing investigations and privacy interests. Legal experts have said that releasing unredacted materials could affect pending prosecutions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Attorney General Bondi faced congressional questioning about why the department has not released fully unredacted documents. The administration also faced criticism over the extent of redactions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Transparency Act Implementation

Congress passed the Epstein Transparency Act requiring federal agencies to review and release documents related to Epstein's criminal activities and associations. The FBI began its review after the law took effect.

Multiple document batches have been released, naming dozens of individuals who had contact with Epstein. Courts have also released separate batches of Epstein-related materials.
