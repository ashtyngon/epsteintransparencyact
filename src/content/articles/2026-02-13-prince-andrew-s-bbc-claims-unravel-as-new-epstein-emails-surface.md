Prince Andrew's 2019 BBC interview — where he denied sexual abuse allegations and offered explanations that became instant punch lines — is now being held up against newly released Epstein emails. The BBC has published a video comparison, and the network's decision to revisit the disastrous sit-down suggests the documentary record doesn't match what Andrew said on camera.

The timing matters. Andrew settled a civil lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre in February 2022 for a reported 12 million pounds without admitting wrongdoing. He's avoided public comment since. The royal family has shown no interest in addressing the new discrepancies.

## What Andrew Claimed

In the notorious Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, Andrew denied Giuffre's allegations with specifics. He claimed he couldn't have been at a London nightclub with her because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking that night. He said he didn't sweat due to a medical condition from the Falklands War — a claim made to refute Giuffre's account that he was "sweating profusely" while dancing with her.

The interview was so poorly received that Andrew stepped back from royal duties within days.

## What Makes This Different

Andrew's case stands apart because he sat for a lengthy, detailed interview making specific factual claims. Most powerful figures connected to Epstein have refused such on-the-record statements. That makes his version of events easier to test against documentary evidence.

The [Epstein Transparency Act is now law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), and the [FBI has begun reviewing](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) government files related to the case. But the royal family operates outside U.S. jurisdiction, and the British government has shown no appetite for forcing Andrew to answer questions.

## The Accountability Gap

What happens when public figures make demonstrably false statements about their Epstein connections? Andrew paid Giuffre to make her lawsuit go away. He holds no public role and faces no known criminal investigation. The palace declined to comment on the BBC analysis.

The comparison video is public. So are the Epstein files it references. The gap between what Andrew said and what the documents show is now part of the permanent record — even if the institutions protecting him choose to ignore it.
