Newly released emails from the U.S. Department of Justice appear to contradict key statements **Prince Andrew** made during his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, according to a BBC analysis published this week.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The BBC published a side-by-side video comparing Andrew's on-camera denials with the documentary record now available through the **Jeffrey Epstein** files.

The emails, released on Jan. 30 as part of a massive DOJ document dump, show a far closer relationship between Andrew and Epstein than the former prince acknowledged on air -- including exchanges about business ventures, confidential government reports and social introductions.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## What Andrew Stated in the Interview

In the Nov. 16, 2019, Newsnight sit-down with **Emily Maitlis**, recorded two days earlier at Buckingham Palace, Andrew denied allegations made by **Virginia Giuffre** that he had sexually abused her when she was 17.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He said he could not have been at a London nightclub with her on March 10, 2001, because he had taken his daughter Princess Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking that evening.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

He also claimed a medical condition from the Falklands War left him unable to sweat -- a direct response to Giuffre's account that he was perspiring on the dance floor.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Andrew characterized his connection to Epstein as limited, saying it "would be a stretch to say we were close friends."<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The interview was widely described as a public relations disaster. Andrew stepped back from royal duties within days.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Emails Undermine Key Claims

The newly released correspondence paints a starkly different picture of the relationship. On Nov. 30, 2010, Andrew forwarded confidential reports from his official trade envoy visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam to Epstein just minutes after receiving them from his adviser Amit Patel.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> On Christmas Eve that year, he shared a brief on investment opportunities in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, telling Epstein he would welcome his "comments, views or ideas."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Additional exchanges from May and July 2010 show the two men discussing [business deals](/news/2026-02-14-prince-andrew-s-aide-advised-epstein-to-hide-conviction-on-visa-form), including a proposed private investment office that would leverage Andrew's "aura and access."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> In an August 2010 message, Epstein offered to introduce Andrew to a 26-year-old Russian woman; Andrew replied he "would be delighted to see her."<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

A September 2010 email shows Andrew inviting Epstein to "dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy."<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> A deposition from the manager of Epstein's Palm Beach estate, taken in 2009, stated the former prince spent weeks at Epstein's home and received "daily massages."<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Legal and Political Fallout

Andrew settled Giuffre's civil lawsuit in February 2022 for an undisclosed sum -- reported by British media at approximately 12 million pounds -- without admitting wrongdoing.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> In October 2025, he was stripped of his honors and royal titles, including the Duke of York peerage.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), signed into law on Nov. 19, 2025, mandated the release of FBI files related to the case, and the [FBI has begun a formal review](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) of those records.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup><sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The [U.K.'s top prosecutor stated](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) in February 2026 that "nobody is above the law" as Thames Valley Police opened a probe into Andrew's conduct.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Andrew holds no public royal role. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the BBC analysis.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The comparison video and the Epstein files it references are publicly available.
