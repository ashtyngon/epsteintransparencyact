An opinion piece published February 18, 2026 on AOL.com questioned why President Biden did not take action to release Jeffrey Epstein-related documents before leaving office, and whether he should have done so.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Biden left the presidency in January 2026 without issuing executive orders or directives to expedite the release of Epstein files held by federal agencies including the FBI and Department of Justice.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The opinion piece examines this decision, though it does not cite specific statements from Biden administration officials explaining the lack of action.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The question arises one month after the [Epstein Transparency Act became law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), requiring federal agencies to review and release documents connected to Epstein within specific timeframes.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The [FBI announced in January 2026](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) it had begun its review process under the new law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Federal Agency Holdings

Federal agencies have maintained files on Epstein dating back decades.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Epstein died in federal custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on sex trafficking charges and is serving a 20-year federal sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The scope of federal records related to both individuals has been the subject of congressional inquiry for years.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Rep. Nancy Mace [called on the CIA in February 2026](/news/2026-02-18-rep-mace-demands-cia-release-epstein-documents) to release any Epstein documents in its possession.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Transparency Act requires federal agencies to review documents for possible release, with exemptions for information that could compromise national security, interfere with ongoing investigations, or violate victim privacy rights.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The law's implementation timeline extends through 2027 for certain document categories.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Federal agencies now operate under the statutory requirements of the Transparency Act rather than executive discretion alone.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The White House did not issue public statements during Biden's tenure specifically addressing the timing or scope of potential Epstein document releases.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
