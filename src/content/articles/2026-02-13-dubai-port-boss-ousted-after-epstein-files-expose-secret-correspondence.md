Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the executive who built DP World into a global logistics powerhouse, has been replaced as the state-backed company's leader. His name was recently identified in correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein.

DP World confirmed the leadership change but did not explain why the executive who ran the Dubai-based port operator for years is suddenly gone. The timing speaks for itself: Bin Sulayem's departure comes shortly after documents surfaced showing contact with the convicted sex offender and trafficker.

## The Third Major Executive to Fall

Bin Sulayem's ouster follows a pattern. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the files. A [Fortune 500 CEO stepped down](/articles/2026-02-13-billionaire-ceo-resigns-after-epstein-connection-exposed) after his Epstein connection was exposed. Now the head of one of the world's largest port operators is out.

Corporate boards are making a calculation: any documented tie to Epstein, regardless of context, is too toxic to defend. The files don't need to allege wrongdoing. Being named is enough.

## What the Correspondence Reveals

The New York Times identified bin Sulayem in correspondence with Epstein, but the full content remains unknown. No public allegations of wrongdoing have emerged beyond the documented contact.

That gap between "identified in correspondence" and understanding what that correspondence contained is the same problem plaguing the entire document release. [Attorney General Pam Bondi has resisted calls](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) for less-redacted versions, even as the DOJ [tracks which lawmakers search the files](/articles/2026-02-13-doj-tracking-lawmaker-epstein-file-searches-bondi-document-reveals).

## A Career Erased

Bin Sulayem was credited with transforming DP World from a regional player into a force in global trade. That legacy now means little. The company hasn't announced his replacement or clarified whether he retains any position within Dubai's government investment apparatus.

The corporate fallout continues even as basic questions go unanswered. What did the correspondence say? Who else is in these documents? And why are executives losing their jobs over files the government still refuses to fully release?

When [Congressman Thomas Massie read six names into the congressional record](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-on-house-floor) that DOJ had concealed, he forced the issue. Bin Sulayem's case shows the opposite dynamic: his name emerged, and his career ended, with the public still in the dark about what he actually did.
