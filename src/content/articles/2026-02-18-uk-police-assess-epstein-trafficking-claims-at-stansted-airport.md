UK police are assessing allegations that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked women on flights through London Stansted Airport.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Essex Police, which has jurisdiction over the airport located northeast of London, confirmed it is reviewing the claims.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The assessment involves allegations that Epstein used flights through Stansted as part of trafficking operations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

London Stansted Airport serves as a major hub for private aviation in the United Kingdom. The facility handles both commercial and private flights, making it a potential transit point for international travel between the United States and Europe.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## UK Authorities Face Renewed Scrutiny

The Metropolitan Police Service announced in August 2021 that it had completed a review of allegations against Epstein and determined no further action would be taken, stating that potential offenses would have occurred outside UK jurisdiction or would be time-barred.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The current assessment by Essex Police represents a separate inquiry focused specifically on alleged trafficking activities at Stansted Airport.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

British authorities previously launched a [national task force for Epstein trafficking allegations](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) in February 2026 following the release of thousands of documents under the Epstein Transparency Act.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Epstein's International Network

Epstein died in a Manhattan federal jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Federal prosecutors had charged him with operating a trafficking ring that recruited and abused dozens of underage girls at his properties in Manhattan, Palm Beach, and New Mexico between 2002 and 2005.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy. She is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Court documents unsealed in recent years have detailed Epstein's extensive international travel, including frequent trips to Europe. Flight logs from his private aircraft have been the subject of ongoing legal proceedings and investigative reporting.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Prince Andrew faced civil litigation in the United States related to allegations he sexually abused a trafficking victim at properties in London, New York, and the US Virgin Islands. Prince Andrew settled that lawsuit in February 2022 without admitting liability.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2026, requires federal agencies to declassify and release documents related to Epstein's activities and associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
