France's foreign minister announced plans to conduct a full investigation into a French diplomat's alleged connections to Jeffrey Epstein, according to Anadolu Ajansı.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The minister pledged that French authorities would examine the allegations linking the diplomat to the late financier and convicted sex offender, though officials have not disclosed the diplomat's identity or the specific nature of the alleged ties.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The foreign minister's announcement follows a series of Epstein-related investigations already underway in France. In February 2026, [French prosecutors launched two separate probes into Epstein's activities](/news/2026-02-18-french-prosecutors-launch-two-epstein-probes-call-for-victim-complaints), calling for victims to file complaints with authorities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Other French Probes Underway

French prosecutors previously opened an investigation into a different diplomat in February, according to earlier reports. Paris police also conducted a raid at the Arab World Institute as part of an Epstein-related investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

France had [established a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) following the release of thousands of documents by U.S. authorities earlier in February 2026.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died in federal custody in Manhattan in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He had been arrested in July 2019 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. A medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein had previously been convicted in 2008 in Florida on state charges of soliciting a minor and served 13 months in a work-release program. The 2008 plea deal allowed him to avoid federal prosecution at that time.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Document Releases Spur International Action

The recent wave of French investigations follows the February 2026 release of Epstein-related documents by the U.S. Department of Justice. The releases prompted reviews and investigations in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and France.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein maintained properties and business interests in France during the years he was allegedly trafficking minors. French authorities have faced questions about their oversight of his activities within the country.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The foreign minister has not specified a timeline for completing the diplomat investigation or what potential actions might follow its conclusion. French officials have not indicated whether the probe involves reviewing new documents or examining previously known information.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The investigation adds to a growing list of international inquiries examining Epstein's network of associates across multiple countries. U.K. authorities have also pursued multiple investigations related to British figures connected to Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
