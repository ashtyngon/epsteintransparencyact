## Epstein Case Background

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had been convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida, serving 13 months under a controversial non-prosecution agreement.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for sex trafficking crimes related to Epstein's abuse network.

Mar-a-Lago has served as Trump's primary residence since he left office in January 2021. In August 2022, FBI agents executed a search warrant at the estate, recovering classified documents from Trump's time in office. A resulting federal indictment alleged unlawful retention of national defense information, though a federal judge dismissed that case in July 2024.

The investigation into the security breach continues.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
