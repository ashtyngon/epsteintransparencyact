United Nations human rights experts have called for an international investigation into the recently released Epstein files, warning the documents may contain evidence of crimes against humanity, according to Anadolu Agency.

The statement marks the first time an international body has formally raised the possibility that the Epstein case may meet the threshold for crimes against humanity, a designation typically reserved for systematic attacks against civilian populations. Such crimes fall under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and carry no statute of limitations under international law.

The designation requires proof of widespread or systematic attacks against civilians, including enslavement, torture, rape, or sexual violence as part of an organizational policy.

## Government Actions Across Multiple Countries

The files have triggered official responses in multiple nations. France [established a special team to review the documents for French nationals](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) and [opened an investigation into at least one diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe).

The United Kingdom [launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations). Britain's top prosecutor stated ["nobody is above the law"](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) as police examined evidence involving Prince Andrew.

## Pattern of Elite Resignations

Multiple high-profile figures have stepped down since the file release. The [chief of Dubai's ports authority resigned](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails surfaced. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the documents. Casey Wasserman [sold his talent agency and left his Olympic organizing role](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) following revelations about his communications with Ghislaine Maxwell.

## Dispute Over Completeness of Release

The Department of Justice [released what it described as the complete Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed) in mid-February after months of pressure from lawmakers. Attorney General Pam Bondi testified that the DOJ disclosed all available materials.

[Independent analysis found the release represented only 2% of files held by federal agencies](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows).

Representative Thomas Massie [accused the department of excessive redactions](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) and said Bondi [avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) during congressional testimony. Massie later [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files.

Representative Nancy Mace [accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) and [demanded unredacted co-conspirator files](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files). Multiple lawmakers [accused Bondi of "mudding" the list](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) by including deceased celebrities who had no connection to criminal conduct.

## Congressional Subpoenas

Congress authorized the file release through the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), signed into law earlier this year. The legislation required federal agencies to disclose all documents related to Epstein's sex trafficking network.

Lawmakers have issued subpoenas to [Peter Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) and [Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about their connections to Epstein.

## Network Spanning Institutions

The released files document connections spanning academia, finance, politics, and media. Documents show [Epstein pulled strings at the University of Alabama](/news/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama). [Congressional galas sent Epstein invitations years after his arrest](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-invited-to-congressional-galas-years-after-arrest-docs-show). [Political consultants pitched Epstein access to New York Democrats](/news/2026-02-14-consultants-pitched-epstein-access-to-ny-democrats-for-donations) in exchange for campaign donations.

Documents show Epstein [used Nobel Prize access to build his network](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-used-nobel-prize-access-to-lure-elite-network-files-show), and that [Nobel committee chairman Thorbjørn Jagland received gifts from Epstein](/news/2026-02-13-nobel-chief-jagland-got-gifts-from-epstein-emails-reveal).
