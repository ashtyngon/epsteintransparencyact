A physician and podcaster hired by CBS News as a contributor has resigned after his name appeared in court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, The Daily Beast reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Peter Attia, known for his podcast on longevity and health optimization, stepped down from the network following the release of documents that included his name in connection with the disgraced financier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The hiring had been announced by CBS News president Wendy McMahon.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Attia's name surfaced in unsealed court files related to Epstein's criminal case, according to The Daily Beast.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The outlet described McMahon as "MAGA-curious" in its report on the resignation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Nature of Connection Undisclosed

The specific nature of Attia's connection to Epstein as detailed in the documents has not been publicly disclosed. Neither CBS News nor Attia provided detailed public statements about the information contained in the unsealed documents that led to the resignation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The documents are part of ongoing court-ordered unsealing from civil litigation brought by Epstein's victims. Courts have periodically released records including flight logs, address books, and deposition testimony that have named numerous individuals from business, politics, entertainment, and academia who had contact with Epstein over decades.

Attia's resignation marks another in a [series of professional departures](https://epsteintransparencyact.com/news/2026-02-17-full-list-of-politicians-royals-named-in-epstein-files-released) following document releases related to Epstein. Other figures who have stepped down from positions after being named in released files include executives from Goldman Sachs, Dubai Ports, and Hyatt Hotels.

## Epstein Case Background

Epstein died in August 2019 in a Manhattan federal jail cell while facing federal charges of sex trafficking minors. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2025, requires federal agencies to declassify and release documents related to Epstein's case. The law has led to [ongoing releases of previously sealed materials](https://epsteintransparencyact.com/news/2026-02-18-doj-accused-of-flouting-epstein-transparency-act), though some lawmakers have criticized the pace and completeness of the disclosures.

Previous document releases have repeatedly placed individuals in the public spotlight, though inclusion in court records does not necessarily indicate wrongdoing or criminal conduct. The files include a range of materials from civil cases, including depositions, witness statements, and correspondence that mention individuals who had various forms of contact with Epstein.

Federal authorities continue to investigate others who may have facilitated Epstein's crimes. The ongoing releases of documents under court orders and the Transparency Act may lead to additional revelations about his network of associates.
