Law enforcement in both European capitals confirmed the probes are based on information contained in the DOJ documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The investigations represent new law enforcement activity stemming from the recently released files.

## Details of European Probes

Paris police launched an investigation after reviewing the released materials, NBC News reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> London police separately initiated their own probe based on information in the files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The DOJ released the Epstein-related documents in recent weeks following passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, [which President Trump signed into law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) in January 2026. The law requires federal agencies to review and release records connected to Epstein's criminal activities and associates.

[UK police previously announced a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations related to the files. [French prosecutors have also launched separate probes](/news/2026-02-18-french-prosecutors-launch-two-epstein-probes-call-for-victim-complaints) and called for victim complaints following the document release.

## Background on Released Files

The Department of Justice released a tranche of Epstein-related files as part of its obligations under the transparency law. The FBI [began its formal review process](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) following the law's enactment.

Epstein, a financier who cultivated relationships with prominent figures internationally, was arrested in July 2019 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. He died in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on sex trafficking charges and is serving a 20-year federal sentence.

The released files include previously sealed court documents, investigative records, and communications between Epstein and various associates. Epstein maintained properties in multiple countries, and court documents have previously referenced incidents in Paris, London, and other international locations.
