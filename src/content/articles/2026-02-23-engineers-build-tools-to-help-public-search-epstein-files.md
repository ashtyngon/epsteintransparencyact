A team of volunteer engineers built a free online tool to help journalists and researchers search thousands of pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein that were recently released by the Department of Justice, Fast Company reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The project, called Epstein Files Search, allows users to search across the newly released DOJ documents using natural language queries rather than requiring manual review of individual PDFs.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The tool was created by a group of engineers who volunteered their time to make the documents more accessible to the public.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Building the Search Tool

The engineers digitized and indexed the released documents to create a searchable database, according to Fast Company.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The system allows users to enter questions or keywords and receive relevant excerpts from the documents, along with citations showing which specific files contain the information.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The volunteer team worked to process the documents quickly after their release under the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in January 2025.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The law requires federal agencies to declassify and release records related to Epstein and his associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The search tool is free to use and publicly available online, Fast Company reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The engineers behind the project said they wanted to democratize access to the documents, which total thousands of pages.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Technical Processing

The team faced technical challenges in processing the documents, including converting scanned PDFs into searchable text and organizing the material to return relevant results to user queries, according to the report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The engineers used optical character recognition technology and natural language processing to make the documents machine-readable.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The tool allows users to search by name, date, location, or topic, and returns relevant passages from the documents with page references.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The engineers built the system to handle complex queries that might span multiple documents or require cross-referencing different sources within the document collection.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Fast Company reported that the volunteer team includes software engineers, data scientists, and information architects who contributed their expertise pro bono to the project.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The group coordinated remotely to build and deploy the search tool within weeks of the first major document releases.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The volunteer engineers continue to update the search tool as additional documents are released by federal agencies, Fast Company reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The team said they plan to maintain the database and search functionality as long as new material continues to be declassified under the transparency law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

A [separate platform called JeffTube](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse) also launched in February 2026 to help users browse the DOJ Epstein files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
