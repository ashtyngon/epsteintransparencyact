Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri voted against releasing unredacted Epstein files weeks after his political committee received a $50,000 donation from a political action committee whose donors include individuals named in the documents, The New Republic reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Hawley cast one of five GOP votes in January opposing the Epstein Transparency Act, which required full disclosure of government files related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Two weeks before that vote, his leadership PAC received the maximum allowable contribution from Americans for Prosperity Action, according to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by the outlet.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The conservative advocacy group is funded by billionaire donors including several whose names appear in Epstein-related documents, according to The New Republic.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Timeline

Hawley voted no on January 15. The legislation ultimately passed with bipartisan support and [became law](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The $50,000 donation was recorded on December 29, according to FEC records cited by the outlet.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Americans for Prosperity Action does not disclose its donors. Previous reporting has identified major contributors including Les Wexner, the L Brands founder who gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion to Epstein for $0, according to public records.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Wexner now [faces a congressional deposition](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) about that relationship.

At least three other AFP Action major donors appear in newly released Epstein flight logs and email correspondence, according to The New Republic.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Hawley's office did not respond to the outlet's requests for comment about the donation or his vote.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Vote

Hawley joined four other Republicans in voting no: Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Tommy Tuberville. Their stated objections ranged from privacy concerns to states' rights arguments.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Since the act became law, the Justice Department has been [accused of over-redacting released documents](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) and has reportedly been monitoring which lawmakers access the files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Campaign Finance Context

Dark money contributions are legal but do not require public disclosure of donors.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Americans for Prosperity Action spent over $80 million on the 2024 election cycle, providing similar five-figure donations to at least a dozen other senators, according to The New Republic. Most of those senators voted for transparency.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The New York Times has begun an investigation into millions of pages of newly released files.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Transparency advocates have called on Hawley to return the donation and explain his vote.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
