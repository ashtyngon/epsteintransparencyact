**Sen. Jon Husted** (R-Ohio) voted to block the release of unredacted Epstein files in September 2025 after receiving more than $116,000 in campaign contributions over two decades from **Leslie Wexner**, a billionaire identified in DOJ documents as a potential co-conspirator of **Jeffrey Epstein**, The New Republic reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Husted, who was appointed to the Senate in January 2025 after **JD Vance** became vice president, cast a vote on Sept. 10 to table a bipartisan amendment sponsored by Sen. **Chuck Schumer** (D-N.Y.) that would have directed the attorney general to release Epstein-related documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The motion to table passed 51-49 along largely party lines.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## The Wexner Connection

Wexner, the Columbus-based founder of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion at 9 East 71st St. to Epstein for $0, according to public records.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Federal and state campaign finance records reviewed by Snopes show Wexner contributed $116,892 to Husted's campaigns between 2001 and 2025, including a $3,500 donation in July 2025 -- weeks before the September vote.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Wexner distributed more than $250,000 to Republican candidates in the past year, with particular concentration in Ohio, according to FEC records.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Sen. **Bernie Moreno** (R-Ohio) received $3,500 from Wexner in June and initially opposed the file release as well.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Wexner now [faces a congressional deposition](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) about his decades-long financial relationship with Epstein. During [his Feb. 18 testimony before the House Oversight Committee](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony), Wexner confirmed under oath that he donated approximately $117,000 to Husted across multiple campaigns.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## The Reversal

Husted's position shifted in November 2025. When Schumer requested unanimous consent for the Epstein Transparency Act, Husted did not object, effectively signing off on the release of the files.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The legislation [became law on Nov. 19, 2025](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), after passing the House 427-1 and clearing the Senate without opposition.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

After the New Republic report, Husted's campaign spokesperson said the senator had "directed the campaign to donate Wexner's money to charity." The campaign said it donated $34,300 -- covering contributions from Wexner and his wife to both federal and state accounts -- to a Columbus charity that works with human trafficking victims.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Broader Scrutiny of Epstein-Linked Donations

[Other Ohio politicians also received Wexner campaign funds](/news/2026-02-14-ohio-politicians-received-campaign-funds-from-wexner), according to a WFMJ review of state finance records.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Husted is the only senator up for reelection in the 2026 cycle who accepted Wexner donations during the current filing period, making the connection a potential campaign liability.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Since the Epstein Transparency Act became law, the Justice Department has been [accused of over-redacting released documents](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) and has reportedly been [monitoring which lawmakers access the files](/news/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The New York Times has [launched a major investigation](/news/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into the millions of pages of newly released documents.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The day before Wexner's deposition, Husted refused to answer a reporter's question about the donations during a campaign stop in Norwalk, Ohio, turning his head without responding.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>
