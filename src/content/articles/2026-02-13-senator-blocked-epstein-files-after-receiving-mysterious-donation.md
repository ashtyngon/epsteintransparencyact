A Republican senator voted against releasing unredacted Epstein files weeks after his political committee received a $50,000 donation from a dark money group with ties to billionaires named in the documents, The New Republic reports.

Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri cast one of five GOP votes in January opposing the Epstein Transparency Act. The legislation required full disclosure of government files related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. Two weeks before that vote, his leadership PAC received the maximum allowable contribution from Americans for Prosperity Action, according to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by the outlet.

The conservative advocacy group is funded by billionaire donors including several with documented connections to Epstein, The New Republic found.

## The Timeline

Hawley voted no on January 15, nearly derailing legislation that ultimately passed with bipartisan support and [became law](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law). The $50,000 donation arrived December 29.

Americans for Prosperity Action does not disclose its donors. But previous reporting has identified major contributors including Les Wexner, the L Brands founder who gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and now [faces a congressional subpoena](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) over that relationship.

At least three other AFP Action megadonors appear in newly released Epstein flight logs and email correspondence, according to The New Republic.

Hawley's office did not respond to the outlet's requests for comment about the donation or his vote.

## The Obstruction Campaign

Hawley has built a public brand as a crusader against elite corruption. His opposition to transparency in this case breaks with that image.

He joined four other Republicans in voting no: Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Tommy Tuberville. Their stated objections ranged from privacy concerns to states' rights arguments.

Since the act became law, the Justice Department has been [accused of over-redacting released documents](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) and [monitoring which lawmakers access the files](/articles/2026-02-13-doj-tracking-lawmaker-epstein-file-searches-bondi-document-reveals). [President Trump called for ending the investigation entirely](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) before reversing course under public pressure.

## Follow the Money

Dark money contributions are legal but deliberately opaque. Wealthy donors influence policy while avoiding public scrutiny—the exact arrangement that benefits individuals who prefer certain files stay sealed.

Americans for Prosperity Action spent over $80 million on the 2024 election cycle, providing similar five-figure donations to at least a dozen other senators. Most of them voted for transparency.

Every week brings new revelations about powerful figures working to minimize their exposure. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-epstein-links) after emails surfaced. A [DP World CEO was forced out](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails) over similar revelations. [College presidents and professors](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) scrambled to explain their connections.

The [New York Times is now conducting a massive investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into millions of pages of newly released files. More names will surface. More senators may face questions about who funded their campaigns—and what those donors expected in return.

Transparency advocates are calling on Hawley to return the donation and explain his vote.
