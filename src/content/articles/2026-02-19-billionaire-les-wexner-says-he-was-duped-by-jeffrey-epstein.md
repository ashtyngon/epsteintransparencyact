[Wexner's testimony](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony) occurred as part of congressional investigations following the enactment of the Epstein Transparency Act, which requires federal agencies to review and release documents related to Epstein's criminal activities and associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

During the hearing, Wexner maintained that he had no knowledge of Epstein's sex trafficking operation or abuse of underage girls.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Wexner-Epstein Financial Relationship

Wexner served as Epstein's most significant client during the 1980s and 1990s, granting him extensive power of attorney over his financial affairs.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Epstein managed Wexner's money and controlled aspects of his business empire, which included L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Court documents and investigative reporting have revealed that Wexner transferred ownership of his New York mansion to Epstein for $0 in 1998. Epstein held power of attorney over the billionaire's financial assets and was registered as the sole trustee of Wexner's charitable foundation with signature authority over his bank accounts.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Documents from civil litigation involving Epstein's victims have shown that some abuse occurred at properties owned by Wexner, including the New York mansion and a property in Ohio.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

In 2019, after Epstein's arrest on federal charges, Wexner released a statement saying he had severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after learning of his "inappropriate behavior." In a 2019 letter to members of his foundation, Wexner wrote that being associated with Epstein was "the greatest regret of my life."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls. He was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, in what was ruled a suicide. His associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
