Maria Farmer, an Epstein survivor, called billionaire Leslie Wexner's recent congressional testimony "abhorrent" in a statement published Sunday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Farmer said she "suffered abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell" at Wexner's estate.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The statement responds to Wexner's appearance before the House Oversight Committee, where the former Victoria's Secret parent company CEO [testified about his relationship with Epstein](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Wexner Testified Before Congress

Wexner appeared before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month to answer questions about his association with Epstein, who managed his personal finances during the 1980s and 1990s. Wexner has said he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after learning of his guilty plea to state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida.

[Rep. Nasir Ansari (D-Minn.) publicly questioned](/news/2026-02-19-rep-ansari-doubts-wexner-s-epstein-testimony-credibility) the credibility of Wexner's testimony, stating he found it "difficult to believe" that Wexner was unaware of Epstein's activities.

## Farmer's Allegations

Farmer has publicly stated that abuse occurred at a property owned by Wexner.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She is one of the earliest known accusers of Epstein and Maxwell, having filed a complaint with the FBI in 1996 about her experiences.

Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

## Ongoing Congressional Investigation

Wexner has not been charged with any crimes related to Epstein's activities. He told Congress he was misled by Epstein during their business relationship.

The House Oversight Committee's investigation into Epstein's network and the institutions that enabled his activities remains ongoing. Multiple witnesses have appeared before the committee as part of its inquiry into how Epstein maintained access to wealthy and powerful individuals for decades.
