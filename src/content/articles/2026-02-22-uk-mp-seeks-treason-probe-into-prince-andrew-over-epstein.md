A British Member of Parliament has called for a treason investigation into Prince Andrew over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, while the UK government is reportedly considering legislation to remove Andrew from the royal line of succession, according to The Times of India.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Times of India report does not identify the MP making the treason demand or specify which government officials are considering succession removal legislation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The report also does not detail what specific allegations would form the basis of a treason probe or provide a timeline for potential parliamentary action.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Andrew currently holds the position of eighth in line to the British throne.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Removing him from the line of succession would require an act of Parliament, as succession is governed by statute in the United Kingdom.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Treason Charges Rare in Modern UK

Treason charges in the United Kingdom historically involve acts against the Crown or the state's security. The Times of India report does not elaborate on how Andrew's association with Epstein would meet the legal threshold for treason.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The call for a treason investigation comes as [Prince Andrew faces an expanded police probe](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-in-london-over-epstein-documents) following the release of documents related to Epstein. [Police have conducted searches at Andrew's Royal Lodge residence](/news/2026-02-22-police-continue-search-at-prince-andrew-s-royal-lodge-over-epstein-ties) in connection with the investigation.

Andrew has denied allegations of sexual misconduct. He reached a settlement in February 2022 with Virginia Giuffre, who alleged Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17 after being trafficked by Epstein. The settlement included no admission of liability.

## Epstein Case Context

Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Epstein had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges in Florida as part of a non-prosecution agreement.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on five counts including sex trafficking of minors. She is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.

The potential removal of Andrew from succession would mark an unprecedented formal separation of a senior royal from the line of succession based on conduct rather than voluntary abdication.
