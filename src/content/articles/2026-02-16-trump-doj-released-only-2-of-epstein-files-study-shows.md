**Attorney General Pam Bondi** stated over the weekend that the Department of Justice has released "all" files related to Jeffrey Epstein, naming over 300 individuals in a letter to Congress. An independent analysis challenges that characterization. According to research highlighted by The Independent, the DOJ has made public only approximately 2% of the Epstein-related material in its possession.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The discrepancy centers on what constitutes a complete release. Bondi's office sent Congress a list that included deceased celebrities such as **Elvis Presley** and **Marilyn Monroe**, both of whom died decades before Epstein's documented activities.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The letter has drawn criticism from lawmakers who accuse the DOJ of padding the list with figures unrelated to alleged criminal activity.

**Rep. Thomas Massie** stated to The American Conservative that the DOJ continues withholding documents despite the federal Epstein Transparency Act, which mandates disclosure. Massie [previously declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files, and has [said he lost confidence in AG Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) following recent hearings.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## The 2% Figure

The analysis cited by The Independent examined the volume of material released against FBI statements about total holdings.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Bureau has acknowledged possession of thousands of files related to Epstein's network, including [thousands of documents about a Detroit millionaire's island operation](/news/2026-02-14-fbi-holds-thousands-of-files-on-detroit-millionaire-s-secret-island-operation).<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The DOJ's weekend letter to Congress provided names but offered limited context about the nature or significance of each individual's appearance in Epstein-related documents. Members of Congress accused Bondi of padding the list by including deceased celebrities who could not have had contact with Epstein during his lifetime.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

**Rep. Nancy Mace** accused the DOJ of withholding names in the Epstein files release. Multiple lawmakers from both parties have pressed Bondi to explain the redactions that remain in released documents.

## Bannon's Contact With Epstein

The New York Times reported Sunday that **Steve Bannon** maintained what texts indicate was a "seemingly chummy relationship" with Epstein after the financier's conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The messages show ongoing contact between the two men.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

According to the Times, Bannon explained the relationship as an attempt to get Epstein to "open up" about his connections. Previously reported emails showed that Bannon discussed Pope Francis with Epstein, according to DOJ files released last week.

Bannon has not fully explained the extent or purpose of his communications with Epstein.

## New Platform Emerges

A platform called **"JeffTube"** has launched to organize the DOJ's video archive of Epstein-related material, according to NDTV Profit. The platform provides searchable access to video content that has been released.

The site emerged as public interest in the files increased. Epstein emails have circulated on social media, with users creating databases and search tools independent of official government releases.

UNILAD reported that newly released documents include records of Epstein's Amazon purchases, though the outlet did not provide specifics about the orders.

## International Investigations

Epstein's documented connections have prompted investigations beyond U.S. borders. The Independent catalogued multiple countries that have opened probes into the financier's international network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**France** has set up a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals. French prosecutors are investigating a diplomat whose name appeared in released communications.

The **United Kingdom** launched a national task force for Epstein trafficking allegations. Britain's top prosecutor stated "nobody is above the law" as police examine evidence involving **Prince Andrew**. Newly released emails contradicted claims Prince Andrew made during his BBC interview. Documents show that Prince Andrew's aide advised Epstein on concealing his conviction on a visa form, according to the released files.

Indian officials face scrutiny after a businessman, minister, and guru were named in the files. The global scope extends to multiple continents.

## Congressional Response

The American Conservative reported that Massie continues to challenge the DOJ's disclosure compliance. The Kentucky congressman has criticized the Trump DOJ over Epstein file redactions, arguing that the federal transparency law requires unredacted release of non-classified material.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

During a recent hearing, Massie stated that Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors who attended the proceedings. The survivors have called for complete disclosure of files that could identify co-conspirators.

**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** called Trump's Epstein file handling a "political miscalculation." **Tim Dillon** and other conservative commentators expressed frustration after Bondi's recent congressional testimony, with Dillon stating "they're all unprepared," according to The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Rep. Ro Khanna** wrote that Epstein's network "knew enough to know better" about the financier's activities. One lawmaker named six men not included in the official Epstein files release despite the transparency act, arguing the DOJ's disclosure omitted significant figures.

## Bondi's Defense

In response to the criticism, Bondi has defended the release as complete. She listed 300 names in the DOJ's letter to Congress, including the deceased celebrities that drew lawmaker complaints.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The Attorney General stated the DOJ released "all" Epstein files with full names listed. Her office has maintained that remaining redactions protect ongoing investigations, grand jury materials, and victim privacy.

During her testimony, Bondi discussed stock market performance when questioned about the files, according to criticism reported by The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Ongoing Developments

The file releases have prompted global resignations and new investigations. Multiple figures have left positions after being named in communications.

Academic institutions face continued scrutiny. College presidents and professors were named in the Epstein files. Documents showed Epstein sought to influence admissions at the University of Alabama.

**Craven County Schools** in North Carolina responded after student records were found in Epstein files. The district stated it is reviewing the documents to understand how student information appeared in Epstein's possession.

Released emails showed Epstein expressed sympathy for Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings, according to newly public communications. Other documents showed Epstein was invited to congressional events years after his 2008 arrest.

Congressional subpoenas remain active for billionaire Les Wexner and Peter Mandelson. Both men are scheduled to testify about their contacts with Epstein. Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner, according to documents.

Massie continues to press the DOJ on the 98% of files that, according to the analysis, remain undisclosed. The transparency act mandates review and release of all non-classified materials. No timeline has been provided for additional document production.
