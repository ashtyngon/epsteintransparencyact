**Attorney General Pam Bondi** declared over the weekend that the Department of Justice has released "all" files related to Jeffrey Epstein, naming over 300 individuals in a letter to Congress. A new analysis challenges that assertion. According to research highlighted by The Independent, the DOJ has made public only approximately 2% of the Epstein-related material in its possession.

The discrepancy centers on what constitutes a complete release. Bondi's office sent Congress a list that included deceased celebrities such as **Elvis Presley** and **Marilyn Monroe**, both of whom died decades before Epstein's criminal activities. The letter has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers who accuse the DOJ of obscuring names of potential witnesses or associates by padding the list with irrelevant figures.

**Rep. Thomas Massie** stated to The American Conservative that the DOJ continues withholding documents despite the federal Epstein Transparency Act, which mandates disclosure. Massie [previously declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files, and has [lost confidence in AG Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) following recent hearings.

## The 2% Question

The analysis cited by The Independent examined the volume of material released against FBI statements about the total holdings. The Bureau has acknowledged possession of thousands of files related to Epstein's network, including [thousands of documents about a Detroit millionaire's secret island operation](/news/2026-02-14-fbi-holds-thousands-of-files-on-detroit-millionaire-s-secret-island-operation).

The DOJ's weekend letter to Congress provided names but offered limited context about the nature or significance of each individual's connection to Epstein. [Congress has accused Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) of "mudding" the list by including deceased celebrities who could not have had contact with Epstein during his lifetime.

**Rep. Nancy Mace** accused the DOJ of [hiding names in the Epstein files release](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release). Multiple lawmakers from both parties have pressed Bondi to explain the redactions that remain in released documents.

## Bannon's Relationship With Epstein

The New York Times reported Sunday that **Steve Bannon** maintained what texts indicate was a "seemingly chummy relationship" with Epstein even after the financier's conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The messages show ongoing contact between the two men.

According to the Times, Bannon explained the relationship as an attempt to get Epstein to "open up" about his connections. Previously reported emails showed that [Bannon discussed "taking down" Pope Francis with Epstein](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files), according to DOJ files released last week.

The texts reveal Bannon standing by Epstein "despite Epstein's toxicity," according to the Times. Bannon, who hosts a MAGA podcast, has not fully explained the extent or purpose of his communications with the convicted sex offender.

## New Platform Emerges

A YouTube clone called **"JeffTube"** has launched to organize the DOJ's video archive of Epstein-related material, according to NDTV Profit. The platform [makes the DOJ's Epstein files easier to browse](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse), providing searchable access to video content that has been released.

The site emerged as public interest in the files surged. [Epstein emails have spread across social media in a viral leak](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-emails-spread-across-social-media-in-viral-leak), with users creating databases and search tools independent of official government releases.

UNILAD reported that newly released documents include records of Epstein's Amazon purchases, though the outlet did not provide specifics about the orders or their significance to ongoing investigations.

## International Investigations Expand

Epstein's connections have triggered investigations beyond U.S. borders. The Independent catalogued multiple countries that have opened probes into the financier's international network.

**France** has [set up a special team to review Epstein files for French nationals](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals). French prosecutors are [investigating a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) whose name appeared in released communications.

The **United Kingdom** launched a [national task force for Epstein trafficking allegations](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations). Britain's top prosecutor stated ["nobody is above the law"](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) as police probe **Prince Andrew**. New emails have caused [Prince Andrew's BBC claims to unravel](/news/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface). Documents show that [Prince Andrew's aide advised Epstein to hide his conviction on a visa form](/news/2026-02-14-prince-andrew-s-aide-advised-epstein-to-hide-conviction-on-visa-form).

[Indian officials](/news/2026-02-14-indian-businessman-minister-guru-named-in-epstein-files) face scrutiny after a businessman, minister, and guru were named in the files. The global scope extends to multiple continents, with The Sunday Guardian noting that while the Epstein files are "massive in volume," they remain smaller in scale than the Panama Papers or Pandora Papers leaks.

## Congressional Response

The American Conservative reported that Massie continues to challenge the DOJ's disclosure compliance. The Kentucky congressman has [ripped the Trump DOJ over Epstein file redactions](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions), arguing that the federal transparency law requires unredacted release of non-classified material.

During a recent hearing, Massie stated that [Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) who attended the proceedings. The survivors have pressed for complete disclosure of files that could identify co-conspirators.

**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** [blasted Trump's Epstein file handling as a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation), signaling concern within the MAGA wing of the Republican Party. Right-wing podcasters have also turned critical. The Independent reported that **Tim Dillon** and other MAGA-aligned commentators expressed frustration after Bondi's recent congressional testimony, with Dillon stating "they're all unprepared."

**Rep. Ro Khanna** said Epstein's network ["knew enough to know better"](/news/2026-02-16-rep-khanna-epstein-s-network-knew-enough-to-know-better) about the financier's criminal conduct. One lawmaker [named six men hidden in Epstein files](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) despite the transparency act, arguing the DOJ's official release omitted significant figures.

## Bondi's Defense

In response to the criticism, Bondi has defended the release as complete. She [listed 300 names in the DOJ's letter to Congress](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release), including the [dead celebrities that drew lawmaker complaints](/news/2026-02-15-bondi-named-dead-celebrities-in-epstein-email-list).

The Attorney General [stated the DOJ released "all" Epstein files with full names listed](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed). Her office has maintained that remaining redactions protect ongoing investigations, grand jury materials, and victim privacy.

During her testimony, Bondi diverted to discussing the stock market, according to podcaster criticism reported by The Independent. The performance has drawn scrutiny from figures across the political spectrum.

## Ongoing Consequences

The file releases have triggered [global resignations and new investigations](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-files-trigger-global-resignations-new-investigations). Multiple high-profile figures have stepped down from positions after being named in communications.

Academic institutions face continued scrutiny. [College presidents and professors were named in the Epstein files fallout](/news/2026-02-16-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout). Documents showed [Epstein pulled strings at the University of Alabama](/news/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama).

**Craven County Schools** in North Carolina [responded after student records were found in Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-craven-county-schools-responds-to-student-records-found-in-epstein-files). The district stated it is reviewing the documents to understand how student information appeared in Epstein's possession.

Released emails showed [Epstein sympathized with Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-emails-sex-abuser-sympathized-with-kavanaugh-during-confirmation), according to newly public communications. Other documents revealed [Epstein was invited to congressional galas years after his 2008 arrest](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-invited-to-congressional-galas-years-after-arrest-docs-show).

Congressional subpoenas remain active for [billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and [Peter Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe). Both men are scheduled to testify about their connections to Epstein. [Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner](/news/2026-02-14-ohio-politicians-received-campaign-funds-from-wexner), adding pressure to the billionaire's testimony.

Massie continues to press the DOJ on the 98% of files that, according to the new analysis, remain undisclosed. The transparency act mandates review and release of all non-classified materials. No timeline has been provided for additional document production.
