**Attorney General Pam Bondi** stated over the weekend that the Department of Justice has released "all" files related to Jeffrey Epstein, naming over 300 individuals in a letter to Congress. An independent analysis challenges that characterization. According to research highlighted by The Independent, the DOJ has made public only approximately 2% of the Epstein-related material in its possession.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The discrepancy centers on what constitutes a complete release. Bondi's office sent Congress a list that included deceased celebrities such as **Elvis Presley** and **Marilyn Monroe**, both of whom died decades before Epstein's documented activities.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The letter has drawn criticism from lawmakers who accuse the DOJ of padding the list with figures unrelated to alleged criminal activity.

**Rep. Thomas Massie** stated to The American Conservative that the DOJ continues withholding documents despite the federal Epstein Transparency Act, which mandates disclosure. Massie [previously declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files, and has [said he lost confidence in AG Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) following recent hearings.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## The 2% Figure

The analysis cited by The Independent examined the volume of material released against FBI statements about total holdings.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Bureau has acknowledged possession of thousands of files related to Epstein's network, including [thousands of documents about a Detroit millionaire's island operation](/news/2026-02-14-fbi-holds-thousands-of-files-on-detroit-millionaire-s-secret-island-operation).<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The DOJ's weekend letter to Congress provided names but offered limited context about the nature or significance of each individual's appearance in Epstein-related documents. Members of Congress accused Bondi of padding the list by including deceased celebrities who could not have had contact with Epstein during his lifetime.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

**Rep. Nancy Mace** accused the DOJ of withholding names in the Epstein files release. Multiple lawmakers from both parties have pressed Bondi to explain the redactions that remain in released documents.

## Congressional Response

The American Conservative reported that Massie continues to challenge the DOJ's disclosure compliance. The Kentucky congressman has criticized the Trump DOJ over Epstein file redactions, arguing that the federal transparency law requires unredacted release of non-classified material.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

During a recent hearing, Massie stated that Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors who attended the proceedings. The survivors have called for complete disclosure of files that could identify co-conspirators.

**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** called Trump's Epstein file handling a "political miscalculation." Conservative commentators have also expressed frustration after Bondi's recent congressional testimony, with several calling the DOJ's responses inadequate.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**Rep. Ro Khanna** wrote that Epstein's network "knew enough to know better" about the financier's activities. Bipartisan pressure continues to mount for the DOJ to explain why the vast majority of files remain undisclosed despite the transparency act's mandate.

## Bondi's Defense

In response to the criticism, Bondi has defended the release as complete. She listed 300 names in the DOJ's letter to Congress, including the deceased celebrities that drew lawmaker complaints.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The Attorney General stated the DOJ released "all" Epstein files with full names listed. Her office has maintained that remaining redactions protect ongoing investigations, grand jury materials, and victim privacy.

During her testimony, Bondi discussed stock market performance when questioned about the files, according to criticism reported by The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Massie continues to press the DOJ on the 98% of files that, according to the analysis, remain undisclosed. The transparency act mandates review and release of all non-classified materials. No timeline has been provided for additional document production.
