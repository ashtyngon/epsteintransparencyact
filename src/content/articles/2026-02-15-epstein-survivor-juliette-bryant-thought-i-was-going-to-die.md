Juliette Bryant, who has said she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, told investigators she thought she was "going to die" during an alleged assault on his private jet, according to newly released documents reported by The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Bryant described the alleged assault as occurring while she was being flown to Epstein's private island. Once the plane landed, Bryant said she had "no way of getting away."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Testimony Details

Bryant's account, as reported by The Independent, describes an alleged attack that began in the air and continued after the plane touched down on Little St. James, Epstein's island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to Bryant, the location left her with no means of leaving without Epstein's cooperation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The testimony appeared in documents released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which requires the unsealing of FBI and DOJ files related to the case.

Epstein's former associate Ghislaine Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking minors. Maxwell recently [offered to provide what she called the "truth"](/news/2026-02-15-ghislaine-maxwell-offers-to-reveal-truth-in-exchange-for-clemency) in exchange for clemency.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The DOJ continues to hold thousands of pages of files related to Epstein's network. Attorney General Pam Bondi has faced [congressional questioning](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) over the pace of releases and the extent of redactions.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>
