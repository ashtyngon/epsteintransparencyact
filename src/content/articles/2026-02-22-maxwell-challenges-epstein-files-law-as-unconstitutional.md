**EDITOR'S NOTE: QUALITY_FAIL — Insufficient source material**

The provided source is only a headline from an RSS feed with no article content. I cannot fact-check the specific claims in the draft (constitutional grounds cited, which documents are targeted, Maxwell's legal team's statements, etc.) because the full News International article is not available.

Below is the maximum publishable version using ONLY information that can be verified from the headline and previously published context on this site. However, this article should not be published without access to the full source article.

Ghislaine Maxwell has filed a legal challenge seeking to block further release of documents under the Epstein Transparency Act, calling the law unconstitutional, The News International reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for sex trafficking crimes related to Jeffrey Epstein. The News International report did not provide details about the specific constitutional arguments Maxwell's legal team raised or which documents the challenge targets.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act requires federal agencies to declassify and release records related to Epstein's activities and associates. The law was signed on January 7, 2026, after passing both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Previous Clemency Offer

Maxwell [previously offered to reveal information](/news/2026-02-15-ghislaine-maxwell-offers-to-reveal-truth-in-exchange-for-clemency) in exchange for clemency in February 2026, though that offer did not result in any agreement with federal prosecutors.

The FBI began reviewing Epstein-related records in January 2026 following the law's enactment.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Federal agencies have released multiple batches of documents since then, including materials that reference Maxwell's role in Epstein's network.

Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on five counts related to recruiting and grooming underage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein between 1994 and 2004. She was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison in June 2022 and is currently incarcerated at FCI Tallahassee in Florida.

## Document Fight

This is Maxwell's second legal effort to limit disclosure of materials related to her involvement with Epstein. In February 2026, she [filed a separate challenge](/news/2026-02-21-ghislaine-maxwell-fights-release-of-90-000-epstein-files) seeking to block release of approximately 90,000 pages of documents.

The News International report did not indicate when Maxwell filed the constitutional challenge or whether a court has scheduled a hearing on the motion.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
