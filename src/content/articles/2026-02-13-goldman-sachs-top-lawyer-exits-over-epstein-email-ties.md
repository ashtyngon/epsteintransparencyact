# Top Goldman Sachs Lawyer Kathy Ruemmler to Leave Firm Amid Epstein Files Fallout

**Kathy Ruemmler**, the top lawyer at **Goldman Sachs**, announced she will leave the Wall Street firm following controversy over her email correspondence with **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to NBC News. The departure comes amid ongoing scrutiny of individuals connected to Epstein revealed in unsealed documents.

Ruemmler's connection to Epstein has drawn public attention as part of the broader fallout from the release of Epstein files. The documents have exposed previously unknown or underreported relationships between the disgraced financier and prominent figures in business, politics, and law. Her email exchanges with Epstein became a point of controversy for Goldman Sachs, one of the world's most prominent investment banks.

## Ruemmler's Role at Goldman Sachs

Ruemmler served as Goldman Sachs' general counsel, the firm's highest-ranking legal position. In this role, she oversaw all legal matters for the bank and advised senior leadership on regulatory and compliance issues.

Before joining Goldman Sachs, Ruemmler served as White House Counsel under President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2014. She previously worked as a federal prosecutor and was part of the legal team that prosecuted Enron executives.

## Epstein Files Continue to Impact High-Profile Figures

The release of Epstein-related documents has led to mounting pressure on individuals whose connections to the financier have been revealed. Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. Since then, court documents, flight logs, and correspondence have been gradually unsealed, exposing the extent of his network.

The specific content of Ruemmler's email correspondence with Epstein has not been fully detailed in public reports. However, the revelation was significant enough to prompt her departure from one of Wall Street's most powerful institutions.

Goldman Sachs has not publicly commented on the circumstances surrounding Ruemmler's exit beyond confirming her departure. The timing suggests the bank is managing reputational concerns related to the Epstein association.
