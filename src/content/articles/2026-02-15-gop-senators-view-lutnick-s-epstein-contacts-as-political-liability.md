Republican senators view Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's contacts with Jeffrey Epstein as a political liability, according to KFOR.

The report did not specify which senators raised concerns or detail the nature of Lutnick's documented interactions with the convicted sex offender.

Lutnick, who leads Cantor Fitzgerald, was confirmed as Commerce Secretary in early 2025. His name has surfaced in files released under the Epstein Transparency Act.

## GOP Fractures Over File Handling

The senatorial concerns add to Republican tensions over the administration's approach to Epstein files. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene [called the handling a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) last week. Rep. Thomas Massie [labeled the current government the "Epstein Administration"](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) over disputes about redactions.

The Justice Department has [heavily redacted names](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) in documents released under the transparency law. Attorney General Pam Bondi has defended the redactions in congressional hearings, citing protection of ongoing investigations.

## Pattern of Departures

The file releases have triggered resignations across multiple sectors. Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down after being named in documents. A Dubai ports chief resigned after hundreds of emails surfaced. Casey Wasserman sold his talent agency following exposure of communications with Ghislaine Maxwell.

No Republican senators have publicly called for Lutnick's resignation. No formal investigation into his Epstein contacts has been announced.
