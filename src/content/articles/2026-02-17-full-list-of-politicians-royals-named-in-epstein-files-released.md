At least 12 prominent figures across business, politics, and international institutions have left their positions after being named in Justice Department files documenting Jeffrey Epstein's network. The departures span continents and industries, from Olympic sports leadership to private equity to European diplomatic posts.

Casey Wasserman, chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, announced his exit from the sports marketing firm he founded after emails revealed [his communications with Ghislaine Maxwell](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations). Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has called for Wasserman to step down from his Olympic leadership role as well.

Tom Pritzker, chairman of Hyatt Hotels and heir to the Pritzker fortune, [resigned from his position](/news/2026-02-16-hyatt-heir-tom-pritzker-steps-down-over-epstein-contact-links) after his contact information appeared in the released documents. Pritzker did not issue a public statement about his connection to Epstein.

## Corporate and Legal Departures

Kam Ghafarian, chief executive of Dubai Ports World, [left his position](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after DOJ files showed hundreds of emails between him and Epstein. The correspondence included discussions about business ventures and social gatherings.

Kathryn Ruemmler, general counsel at Goldman Sachs and former White House counsel under President Obama, resigned after documents showed she maintained contact with Epstein years after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Ruemmler had previously acknowledged meeting with Epstein in 2014 for career advice.

A senior partner at Clifford Chance, one of the world's largest law firms, left the firm after emails exposed communications with Epstein about legal matters and social events. The firm declined to comment.

Peter Mandelson withdrew as UK ambassador-designate to the United States after Congress issued a subpoena demanding testimony about his relationship with Epstein. Documents showed the former Labour minister corresponded with Epstein about political access and introductions in Britain.

Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York and ex-wife of Prince Andrew, announced she would close six of her business entities after files showed Epstein provided her with financial assistance. The companies will be dissolved in coming weeks, according to UK business registry filings.

Thorbjørn Jagland, former secretary general of the Council of Europe and chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, resigned from remaining advisory positions after emails revealed he accepted gifts from Epstein and facilitated introductions to Nobel Prize ceremonies and laureates.

## Academic and Media Sectors

Columbia University removed multiple staff members who facilitated a dental school admission connected to Epstein. The university conducted an internal review but did not identify the removed personnel by name.

A media executive and a technology sector CEO also left their positions after being named in the files, according to Newsweek's compilation. Their departures bring the total documented resignations to at least 12 across six countries.

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the department released all files required under the Epstein Transparency Act, though Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Nancy Mace continue pressing for additional documents. An analysis by document transparency researchers found the Justice Department released approximately 2% of Epstein-related files in its possession.
