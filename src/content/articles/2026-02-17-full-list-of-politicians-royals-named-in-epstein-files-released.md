At least 12 prominent figures across business, politics, and international institutions have left their positions after being named in Justice Department files documenting Jeffrey Epstein's network, according to Newsweek.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The departures span continents and industries, from Olympic sports leadership to private equity to European diplomatic posts.

Casey Wasserman, chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, announced his exit from the sports marketing firm he founded after emails showed [his communications with Ghislaine Maxwell](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called for Wasserman to step down from his Olympic leadership role as well.

Tom Pritzker, chairman of Hyatt Hotels and heir to the Pritzker fortune, [resigned from his position](/news/2026-02-17-hyatt-billionaire-thomas-pritzker-resigns-over-epstein-ties) after his name appeared in the released documents.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Pritzker stated he exercised "terrible judgment" in maintaining contact with Epstein.

## Corporate and Legal Departures

Kam Ghafarian, chief executive of Dubai Ports World, [left his position](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after DOJ files showed hundreds of emails between him and Epstein.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The correspondence included discussions about business ventures and social gatherings, according to the documents.

Kathryn Ruemmler, general counsel at Goldman Sachs and former White House counsel under President Obama, resigned after documents showed she maintained contact with Epstein years after his 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Ruemmler had previously acknowledged meeting with Epstein in 2014 for career advice.

A senior partner at Clifford Chance, one of the world's largest law firms, left the firm after emails showed communications with Epstein about legal matters and social events, according to reporting. The firm declined to comment.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Peter Mandelson withdrew as UK ambassador-designate to the United States after Congress issued a subpoena requiring testimony about his contacts with Epstein. Documents showed the former Labour minister corresponded with Epstein about political access and introductions in Britain, according to the released files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York and ex-wife of Prince Andrew, announced she would close six of her business entities after files showed Epstein provided her with financial assistance, according to UK business registry filings.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Thorbjørn Jagland, former secretary general of the Council of Europe and chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, resigned from remaining advisory positions after emails showed he accepted gifts from Epstein and facilitated introductions to Nobel Prize ceremonies and laureates, according to the documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Academic and Media Sectors

Columbia University removed multiple staff members who facilitated a dental school admission connected to Epstein. The university conducted an internal review but did not identify the removed personnel by name.

A media executive and a technology sector CEO also left their positions after being named in the files, according to Newsweek's compilation. Their departures bring the total documented departures to at least 12 across six countries.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the department released all files required under the Epstein Transparency Act, though Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Nancy Mace continue pressing for additional documents. An independent analysis found the Justice Department released approximately 2% of Epstein-related files in its possession.
