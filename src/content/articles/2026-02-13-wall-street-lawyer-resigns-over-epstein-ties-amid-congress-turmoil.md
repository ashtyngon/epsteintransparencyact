A top Wall Street lawyer has resigned over ties to Jeffrey Epstein, according to The Hill's Morning Report newsletter, as Congress braces for a prolonged Department of Homeland Security funding crisis.

The resignation comes amid intensifying scrutiny of financial institutions' relationships with the convicted sex offender. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down last week](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-over-epstein-links) after emails surfaced in which he referred to Epstein as an "older brother."

## Congressional Chaos Continues

The timing compounds pressure on lawmakers already struggling with a looming DHS shutdown. Funding is set to expire Saturday with no deal in sight, according to the newsletter roundup, which listed the Wall Street resignation among multiple breaking developments including Trump defending embattled Cabinet members and the reversal of a climate endangerment finding.

The confluence of the Epstein fallout and government funding paralysis underscores how the document release continues to destabilize both financial and political institutions. 

[The New York Times has launched a major investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into millions of pages of Epstein-related files, while [Congress has subpoenaed billionaire Leslie Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about his decades-long financial relationship with Epstein.

Financial institutions are facing mounting legal and reputational consequences. [A federal court recently allowed a lawsuit against Bank of America to proceed](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed), alleging the bank facilitated Epstein's trafficking operations.

The Wall Street resignation adds to a growing list of high-profile departures as previously sealed documents continue to surface, revealing the scope of Epstein's connections across finance, government, and academia.
