# Sarah Ferguson Closes Companies as Global Epstein Scrutiny Intensifies

**Sarah Ferguson**, the Duchess of York, is winding down six of her business entities following new revelations about her relationship with convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to the BBC. The move comes as countries across multiple continents launch formal investigations into Epstein's international network.

The corporate closures represent the latest in a series of professional consequences stemming from the Epstein files release. Ferguson's business decisions follow a pattern of resignations and institutional actions that have hit European figures harder than their American counterparts, according to previous reporting.

## European and Global Investigations Expand

Multiple countries have opened formal inquiries into Epstein's connections within their borders, according to The Independent. France established a specialized team to review the files for French nationals, while UK prosecutors declared "nobody above law" as police launched a national task force to examine trafficking allegations.

Transparency International UK published an analysis examining what the **Peter Mandelson**-Epstein correspondence reveals about Britain's lobbying system. Mandelson, who [faces a congressional subpoena](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) over his Epstein ties, exchanged emails with the financier that raise questions about influence operations.

The international scope of the investigations contrasts with the response in the United States, where [Epstein files have toppled European elites while U.S. officials maintain their positions](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-files-topple-european-elites-while-u-s-officials-keep-power).

## Bannon's Continued Contact With Epstein

**Steve Bannon** maintained what the New York Times described as "seemingly chummy" communications with Epstein despite the financier's status as a registered sex offender. Text messages released in the DOJ files show Bannon developed a relationship with Epstein that he characterized as an attempt to get the convicted trafficker "to open up."

The communications between Bannon and Epstein included discussions about "taking down" Pope Francis, [according to DOJ files](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files). Bannon, described by the Times as a "MAGA podcaster," continued the relationship despite what the newspaper termed "Epstein's toxicity."

The extent of Bannon's contact with Epstein adds to a growing list of high-profile figures whose communications with the financier extended years beyond his 2008 conviction. Documents show [Epstein received invitations to congressional galas years after his arrest](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-invited-to-congressional-galas-years-after-arrest-docs-show).

## "Only 2% Released," Congressman Says

Representative **Thomas Massie** told The American Conservative that the Department of Justice continues withholding Epstein documents despite federal disclosure requirements. Massie's statement to the publication adds specificity to ongoing disputes between Congress and DOJ over the scope of the release.

A separate analysis found [the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows), according to researchers who compared the volume of released material against known holdings. The discrepancy has fueled accusations from multiple lawmakers that DOJ is defying the **Epstein Transparency Act**.

Massie previously stated he has [lost confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over the redaction issue. During a recent hearing, Massie said [Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) present in the room.

Representative **Nancy Mace** accused DOJ of ["mudding" the Epstein list](/news/2026-02-15-lawmakers-accuse-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-names-in-doj-letter) by including deceased celebrities in the **300-name roster** Bondi released. Mace is demanding unredacted files on co-conspirators.

## Document Volume Comparison

The Sunday Guardian published a technical analysis comparing the Epstein files to other major document releases. The publication noted that while the Epstein materials are "massive in volume," they remain smaller in scale than the Pandora Papers, Panama Papers, and Paradise Papers leaks.

The comparison provides context for the scope of the current release. The Epstein files comprise millions of pages, according to [the New York Times' investigation](/news/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files), but represent a smaller data set than previous offshore finance leaks.

A new platform called [JeffTube launched to make the DOJ files easier to browse](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse), according to previous reporting. The tool attempts to organize the released documents for public review.

## UK Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

Transparency International UK's analysis of the Mandelson-Epstein emails focuses on what the correspondence reveals about Britain's regulatory framework for influence operations. The organization, which monitors corruption globally, examined the emails within the context of UK lobbying disclosure requirements.

Mandelson served as a European Union trade commissioner and held other senior government positions. His communications with Epstein occurred during periods when he maintained advisory roles with businesses and institutions.

The UK's [national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) represents the country's most significant law enforcement response to the files. The Metropolitan Police announced the specialized unit would coordinate investigations across multiple jurisdictions.

## Pattern of European Consequences

Ferguson's business closures fit within a documented pattern of professional consequences hitting European figures. Previous reporting identified [Dubai's ports chief](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) who resigned after hundreds of secret Epstein emails surfaced, and [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) who stepped down following the file release.

In contrast, American figures named in the files have largely retained their positions. [Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's Epstein ties](/news/2026-02-15-commerce-secretary-lutnick-s-epstein-ties-become-gop-liability) became what GOP senators privately described as a "political liability," but he remains in office.

The disparity has prompted questions about institutional accountability mechanisms in different jurisdictions. European prosecutors have opened multiple formal investigations, while U.S. law enforcement response has centered on the DOJ's controlled release of redacted documents.

## Congressional Response

Representative **Ro Khanna** stated that members of Epstein's network "knew enough to know better," [according to previous reporting](/news/2026-02-16-rep-khanna-epstein-s-network-knew-enough-to-know-better). His comment addressed the argument that some individuals did not understand Epstein's criminal conduct.

Representative **Marjorie Taylor Greene** [criticized Trump's handling](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) of the file release as a "political miscalculation." Greene's statement represented a break with the administration from a typically loyal ally.

[Congress previously subpoenaed billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), Epstein's longest-standing financial patron. Wexner's scheduled testimony has not yet occurred, according to available records.

## International Coordination

France's specialized review team represents one model for examining the files for national implications. [French prosecutors are investigating a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) whose name appeared in released correspondence.

India has identified [a businessman, minister, and guru](/news/2026-02-14-indian-businessman-minister-guru-named-in-epstein-files) among Indian nationals named in documents. The government has not announced formal investigations.

The FBI maintains [thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's secret island operation](/news/2026-02-16-fbi-holds-thousands-of-files-on-detroit-millionaire-s-island-operation) that remain unreleased. The bureau has cited ongoing investigations as justification for continued redactions.

## Next Steps

No new hearing dates have been announced for congressional testimony. Wexner and Mandelson remain under subpoena, with testimony schedules pending. The UK's national task force has not specified a timeline for concluding its initial review phase.

Bondi maintains the DOJ has [released "all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed), a statement Massie directly contradicts. The congressman told The American Conservative that documents continue to be withheld despite the federal transparency law.

Ferguson has not issued a public statement about the business closures. The BBC reported the wind-down follows "further revelations" but did not specify which newly released documents prompted the decision.
