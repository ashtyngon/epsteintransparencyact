The FBI has been investigating whether Jeffrey Epstein's private jet, known as the "Lolita Express," flew to and from British airports for five years, according to The Sun<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

The probe focuses on establishing flight records for Epstein's aircraft and its movements in and out of the United Kingdom<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The investigation began approximately five years ago and remains ongoing<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

## What the Investigation Covers

The FBI's inquiry centers on determining whether Epstein's Boeing 727 aircraft—which has been referenced in multiple legal proceedings related to his alleged trafficking network—made trips to and from airports on British soil<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

Establishing flight records requires coordination between U.S. and British aviation authorities. Such investigations typically involve examining customs and immigration documentation, airport records, flight manifests, and passenger logs from the time period when Epstein was active.

The "Lolita Express" nickname refers to Epstein's private jet, which became central to allegations in the criminal case against him. Flight logs from the aircraft have been cited in civil lawsuits brought by Epstein's accusers and in congressional investigations into his activities.

## U.K. Connection

The FBI's focus on British airports comes as authorities in the United Kingdom pursue their own investigations into Epstein's connections there. [Police continue searching Prince Andrew's Royal Lodge](/news/2026-02-22-police-continue-search-at-prince-andrew-s-royal-lodge-over-epstein-ties) as part of a widened investigation following his arrest on Epstein-related charges.

Flight records showing arrivals and departures at UK airports could help establish a timeline of Epstein's visits to the United Kingdom. Such records could also identify individuals who traveled with him on the aircraft during those trips.

Epstein died in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy.

## Document Release Efforts

The FBI investigation unfolds as federal agencies work to implement the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in December 2024. The legislation requires the declassification and release of government documents related to Epstein's activities and connections.

The FBI has not publicly disclosed whether airport and flight records fall within the scope of materials being prepared for release under the new law<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

The five-year duration of the airport investigation began around 2021, two years after Epstein's death and during the period when Maxwell faced federal prosecution<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.
