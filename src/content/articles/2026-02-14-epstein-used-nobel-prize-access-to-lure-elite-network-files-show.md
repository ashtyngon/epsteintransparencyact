**Jeffrey Epstein** repeatedly invoked the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in communications with prominent business leaders, politicians and academics, using the prestige of the Nobel Peace Prize as a recruiting tool for his global network, according to files reported by The Independent and corroborated by the Associated Press.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

**Thorbjorn Jagland** -- former Norwegian prime minister (1996-1997), secretary general of the Council of Europe (2009-2019) and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee (2009-2015) -- appears hundreds of times across the millions of documents released by the Justice Department under the Epstein Transparency Act.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> The contacts continued after Epstein's 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor and persisted until close to his death on Aug. 10, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## A Pattern of Name-Dropping

The files reveal a systematic approach: Epstein would establish a relationship with a prominent institutional figure, then reference that connection in outreach to others.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

In a 2013 email to **Richard Branson**, the Virgin Group founder, Epstein wrote that Jagland would be staying with him that September, adding that Branson "might find him interesting."<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> In 2012, Epstein wrote **Larry Summers**, the former U.S. Treasury secretary (1999-2001) and former president of Harvard University (2001-2006), informing him that the "head of the Nobel Peace Prize" was staying with him.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Summers' Harvard tenure overlapped with a period when Epstein donated $9.1 million to the university between 1998 and 2008, according to previous reporting.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Bannon, Trump and the Nobel Prize

In September 2018, Epstein exchanged text messages with **Steve Bannon**, the former White House chief strategist to **President Donald Trump**, in which he referenced the Nobel committee connection.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> In one exchange, Epstein wrote to Bannon that "Donald's head would explode if he knew you were now buds with the guy who on Monday will decide the Nobel Peace Prize."<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Separate files show Bannon and Epstein [discussed plans to "take down" Pope Francis](/news/2026-02-15-steve-bannon-discussed-taking-down-pope-francis-with-epstein-doj-files) in June 2019, one month before Epstein's arrest.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> Bannon also [exchanged text messages with Epstein despite acknowledging the association was "toxic,"](/news/2026-02-16-steve-bannon-texted-with-epstein-despite-toxicity-nyt) according to a New York Times review of the files.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>

In 2014, Epstein informed **Bill Gates**, the Microsoft co-founder, that Jagland had been reelected as head of the Council of Europe. Gates responded asking whether Jagland's Nobel committee role was also in question, the documents show.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## Gifts and Criminal Charges

[Emails reported on Feb. 13](/news/2026-02-13-nobel-chief-jagland-got-gifts-from-epstein-emails-reveal) showed Jagland received gifts from Epstein during the period of their association.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Since the release of the files, Norway's economic crime unit, Okokrim, has charged Jagland, now 75, with "aggravated corruption" in connection with an investigation into whether gifts, travel and loans from Epstein were received in connection with Jagland's public positions.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

**Terje Rod-Larsen**, a Norwegian diplomat who helped broker the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and the Palestinians, is believed to have introduced Jagland into Epstein's orbit, according to the AP. Rod-Larsen and his wife also face corruption charges in Norway stemming from the Epstein files.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## Broader Context

Epstein's Nobel-linked outreach was part of a wider pattern of leveraging institutional prestige documented across the 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos released under the Epstein Transparency Act [signed Nov. 19, 2025](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law). Recent releases have detailed his [contacts with university leaders](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout),<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> [lawyers named in the files](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-emails-expose-ex-clifford-chance-lawyer-s-hidden-ties),<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> and business executives including **Kathryn Ruemmler**, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, [who resigned after being named in the documents](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files).<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>
