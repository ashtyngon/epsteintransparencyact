Jeffrey Epstein name-dropped the head of the Nobel Peace Prize committee in invitations and messages to Richard Branson, Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon, using the connection to draw prominent figures into his network, newly released files show.

The documents reveal Epstein repeatedly referenced Thorbjørn Jagland—former Norwegian prime minister (1996-1997), former secretary general of the Council of Europe (2009-2019), and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee—in communications with businessmen, academics, and political figures. Epstein hosted Jagland, then promoted those meetings when reaching out to other elites. The contacts occurred after Epstein's 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor and continued until close to his death on August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

## Branson, Summers, Bannon Targeted

Branson, the Virgin Group founder and billionaire, received invitations from Epstein advertising access to Jagland. Summers, who served as U.S. Treasury Secretary (1999-2001) and later as president of Harvard University (2001-2006), appeared in communications where Epstein played up his Nobel connections. Summers' Harvard tenure overlapped with a period when Epstein donated $9.1 million to the university between 1998 and 2008. Bannon, who later became chief strategist to President Trump in January 2017, was also contacted by Epstein using his association with the committee head.

The files show a pattern: Epstein would host Jagland, then leverage that relationship in subsequent outreach to other high-profile contacts.

## Gifts and Access

[Emails revealed last week](/articles/2026-02-13-nobel-chief-jagland-got-gifts-from-epstein-emails-reveal) showed Jagland received gifts from Epstein. The new documents show how Epstein capitalized on the relationship, using the Nobel committee leader's visits to position himself as a gateway to one of the world's most prestigious institutions.

The files document Epstein's method across multiple contacts: establish a connection with a prominent institutional figure, then use that connection to recruit others. The Nobel Peace Prize provided access to global prestige that Epstein marketed to his network.

## Broader Network Revealed

Epstein's Nobel-linked outreach was part of a wider pattern of cultivating relationships across business, government, and academia. Recent file releases—part of the 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos released under the Epstein Transparency Act signed November 19, 2025—have exposed his [ties to university leaders](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout), [prominent lawyers](/articles/2026-02-14-epstein-emails-expose-ex-clifford-chance-lawyer-s-hidden-ties), and [business executives](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) including Kathryn Ruemmler, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel.

The communications show Epstein's systematic approach: hosting Jagland gave him a talking point that combined institutional prestige with personal access. The files reveal how he used that combination in invitations and chats with elites spanning multiple industries and political affiliations.
