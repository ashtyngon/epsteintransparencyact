Fast Company published a report tracking the growing number of business leaders who have faced professional consequences after being named in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, according to the outlet's coverage of the ongoing fallout.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The report follows multiple executives who have resigned, been placed on leave, or faced public pressure following their appearance in court filings and investigative materials connected to the late financier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Corporate Executives Face Resignations

At least five high-profile business figures have resigned from leadership positions after Epstein connections emerged in released documents.

Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem [resigned as chairman of Dubai's DP World](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails between him and Epstein were exposed in unsealed court records.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Goldman Sachs' top lawyer [stepped down after being named](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) in released files.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Olympic organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman [exited his position](/news/2026-02-14-olympic-chief-casey-wasserman-exits-after-maxwell-email-revelations) after Maxwell email revelations.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

[Hyatt billionaire Thomas Pritzker resigned](/news/2026-02-17-hyatt-billionaire-thomas-pritzker-resigns-over-epstein-ties) from multiple board positions following disclosure of his Epstein ties.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

[Leon Black's connection](/news/2026-02-15-leon-black-named-in-epstein-files-schools-cancel-photo-day) to Epstein prompted multiple school districts to sever contracts with Lifetouch, a photography company linked to Black's investment firm.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## Document Releases Drive Scrutiny

The professional consequences follow multiple waves of document releases from civil litigation involving Epstein's estate and associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Federal courts have unsealed hundreds of pages of depositions, witness statements, and other materials from civil cases filed by Epstein victims. These releases have occurred in batches over several months, with each new tranche generating media coverage and public attention.

The documents contain varying levels of detail about individuals' relationships with Epstein, from mentions in flight logs to depositions about direct interactions. 

## Congressional Action

Congress passed the Epstein Transparency Act requiring federal agencies to review and declassify government records related to Epstein.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> The FBI [began its review](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) of records under the new law.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

Multiple congressional committees have conducted hearings into how financial institutions handled Epstein's accounts and whether federal prosecutors properly investigated the scope of his criminal enterprise.

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. He died in his jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial. His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges including sex trafficking of minors and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
