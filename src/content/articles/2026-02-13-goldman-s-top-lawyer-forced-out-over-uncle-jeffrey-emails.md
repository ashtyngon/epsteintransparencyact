Kathy Ruemmler resigned as Goldman Sachs' top lawyer after newly released emails revealed she maintained a close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein — calling him "Uncle Jeffrey" and accepting gifts including soup deliveries — long after his conviction on sex crimes.

The correspondence, reported by The Independent, shows a friendship that continued well past Epstein's 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The "Uncle Jeffrey" nickname alone signals an intimacy that contradicts the arms-length professional acquaintance many Epstein contacts have claimed.

## What the Emails Show

The released files document gift exchanges and regular contact between Ruemmler and Epstein. He sent her soup. She stayed close. The emails expose not just occasional correspondence but sustained personal connection with a convicted sex offender.

Goldman Sachs has not explained what it knew about this relationship when it hired Ruemmler, or what prompted her resignation now. The bank's silence raises obvious questions: Was this friendship disclosed during her hiring process? If so, why did Goldman consider it acceptable? If not, how did their vetting miss it?

## Elite Accountability on Display

Ruemmler's departure follows a pattern. High-profile figures are being forced out as the Epstein files expose relationships powerful institutions preferred to keep buried. [DP World's CEO was ousted](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails) after hundreds of emails surfaced. [A billionaire CEO resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-billionaire-ceo-resigns-after-epstein-connection-exposed) under similar pressure.

But resignations aren't transparency. They're damage control. Each executive exit answers one narrow question — was the relationship close enough to be professionally fatal? — while leaving broader questions deliberately unanswered.

Who else appears in those emails? What did Goldman Sachs executives know and when? Why are these documents still being released in dribs and drabs through court orders rather than proactive government disclosure?

## What Goldman Won't Say

Goldman Sachs hasn't announced Ruemmler's replacement. The bank hasn't disclosed whether it conducted an internal review of her Epstein contacts. Most tellingly, Goldman hasn't explained its hiring process or what due diligence, if any, examined her professional relationships before bringing her on as general counsel.

That silence is a choice. Every day Goldman declines to answer these questions is another day the bank signals that transparency applies to everyone except Goldman Sachs.

The Epstein files continue to surface through court-ordered releases and investigative pressure — not because institutions like Goldman voluntarily disclosed them. Ruemmler's "Uncle Jeffrey" emails are public now despite the system designed to protect powerful people, not because of it.

Goldman Sachs is one of the world's most sophisticated financial institutions. It didn't hire a general counsel without vetting. The question is whether that vetting uncovered a relationship executives deemed acceptable, or whether Ruemmler successfully concealed contacts she understood would be disqualifying.

Neither answer reflects well on Goldman. And the bank's refusal to provide one reflects worse.
