The Department of Justice released a list of names connected to Jeffrey Epstein earlier this week but allegedly did not comply with the full requirements of the Epstein Transparency Act, according to The Hill<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The list included individuals mentioned in documents related to Epstein's criminal cases and civil litigation<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

The [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), signed into law in January 2025, mandated that federal agencies review and disclose records related to Epstein within specified timeframes<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>. The law required agencies to provide detailed documentation and justifications for any redactions or withheld information<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>.

## What the DOJ Released

The DOJ's release consisted of names that appeared in previously public court filings and unsealed documents from civil cases involving Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. Legal experts and transparency advocates told The Hill the disclosure may not satisfy the statute's mandate for a comprehensive review of agency records<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

The Hill reported that the list did not include new investigative files or internal agency documents<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The law called for agencies to disclose records in their possession, not merely republish information already available through court proceedings<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

Critics told The Hill that the list appeared to be drawn entirely from court records that journalists and researchers had already compiled and analyzed<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The disclosure did not include FBI investigative files, prosecutorial records from the Southern District of New York, or correspondence between federal officials and Epstein's legal team<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

## Act Requirements

The Transparency Act passed both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support in late 2024<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>. The legislation required the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and other agency heads to conduct searches of their records systems and produce documents related to Epstein's activities, associates, and any federal investigations<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>.

Federal agencies were given 180 days from the law's enactment to complete initial disclosures<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>. The statute included exemptions for classified information related to national security, ongoing criminal investigations, and personal privacy concerns, but required agencies to justify any withholdings in writing<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>.

## Congressional Response

The Hill reported that several members of Congress who sponsored the Transparency Act have not yet issued public statements evaluating whether the DOJ's disclosure meets the law's requirements<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. Congressional oversight committees retain authority to compel additional disclosures if agencies are found to be in noncompliance with the statute<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

The [FBI began its review of Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) following the law's enactment, according to statements from the bureau in early 2025<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>. The agency indicated it was conducting a systematic search of investigative files and other materials responsive to the statute's requirements<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>.

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges related to recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.
