The most powerful attorney in New York's white-shoe legal world watched the calendar with growing dread. **Brad Karp**, chairman of prestigious law firm **Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison**, had known for months that his name appeared in Jeffrey Epstein's files. He had time to prepare, time to position himself, time to get ahead of the story. Instead, according to Above the Law, he remained silent as the clock ran out—a stunning miscalculation for someone who built his career advising Fortune 500 companies on crisis management.

When the Epstein files finally dropped, Karp's decades-long relationship with the convicted sex trafficker became public knowledge. Within days, he was out. His resignation marks the highest-profile corporate casualty yet in a rapidly expanding scandal that has now claimed CEOs on three continents, exposed potential surveillance of lawmakers by the U.S. Attorney General, and fractured the coalition that brought Donald Trump back to power.

But Karp's fall is just one thread in a story that grows more complex—and more troubling—by the day. What emerges from this week's developments is not just a roster of powerful men with questionable associations. It's a picture of institutional resistance to transparency, political fracturing over accountability, and the intricate infrastructure that allowed Epstein to operate at the highest levels of global finance and politics for decades.

## The Executive Purge Goes Global

Karp wasn't alone in losing his position this week. **Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem**, CEO and chairman of **DP World**—which operates Dubai's massive Jebel Ali Port, one of the world's busiest shipping terminals—was replaced after his name appeared in the Epstein files more than **4,700 times**, according to the Justice Department. CBS News reported the removal, though DP World has not publicly commented on whether the Epstein connection directly caused Sulayem's departure.

The sheer volume of Sulayem's mentions in the files raises immediate questions about the nature and extent of his relationship with Epstein. For context, many individuals who had documented business or social interactions with Epstein appear far fewer times in the released materials. The concentration of references suggests either extensive correspondence, repeated business dealings, or both.

These corporate removals reflect growing pressure on boards and shareholders who fear reputational damage from Epstein associations. But they also highlight a troubling reality: most of these executives likely knew about their Epstein connections long before public disclosure forced their hand. The question isn't just who knew Epstein—it's who knew they were in the files and chose to remain silent until exposure became unavoidable.

## When the Hunters Become the Accused

The push for transparency took a bizarre turn this week when **Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche** accused congressional advocates of naming "completely random people" with no actual ties to Epstein. According to The Hill, Blanche specifically called out **Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.)** and **Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)**—two lawmakers who have led the bipartisan charge for full file disclosure—suggesting they had recklessly identified innocent individuals.

The Guardian later confirmed that at least four men named by Khanna in a House floor speech have no documented ties to Epstein. The revelation is significant: it suggests that even within the files, names may appear without indicating meaningful relationships or wrongdoing. Context matters, and Khanna's apparent misstep—whether from misreading documents or drawing unwarranted conclusions—demonstrates the risks of demanding immediate public naming without thorough investigation.

But the criticism from DOJ leadership also feels strategic. By highlighting overreach from transparency advocates, the Justice Department subtly undermines calls for broader release while positioning itself as the measured guardian against reckless disclosure. It's a classic bureaucratic move: defend institutional control by pointing to the chaos that comes from circumventing it.

The bigger question remains unanswered: if DOJ lawyers can identify which names are "random" and which represent genuine associations, why not release the files with proper context and annotation? The existence of spurious mentions doesn't justify wholesale redaction—it justifies better curation.

## The Surveillance Scandal

Perhaps no development this week proved more disturbing than allegations that **Attorney General Pam Bondi** may have monitored lawmakers' search activity during their viewing of unredacted Epstein files. CBS News reported that multiple members of Congress accused Bondi of "spying" on what they searched for in the secure facility where DOJ provided limited file access.

The accusation connects to previous reporting by this site that [DOJ was tracking lawmaker Epstein file searches](/articles/2026-02-13-doj-tracking-lawmaker-epstein-file-searches-bondi-document-reveals), raising constitutional concerns about separation of powers and whether the executive branch can surveil legislative branch activities, even in the name of document security.

Bondi has not directly addressed the surveillance allegations, but the implications are profound. If accurate, the monitoring represents an extraordinary breach of congressional oversight prerogatives. Lawmakers conducting oversight of the executive branch should not have their investigative methods or interests tracked by the subjects of their investigation. It's the equivalent of a police department monitoring which files internal affairs investigators review.

The surveillance claims also feed growing MAGA-world frustration with Bondi's handling of the entire Epstein matter. According to Axios, prominent conservative voices are calling for Bondi's removal, fracturing Trump's coalition over transparency issues. At [Wednesday's contentious hearing](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release), Bondi faced roughly five hours of accusatory questioning. Epstein survivors attended and testified they had not been given the opportunity to provide statements to DOJ under Bondi's leadership. She refused to acknowledge their presence when prompted by lawmakers.

Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) accused Bondi of lying under oath about Trump and Epstein's relationship. She forcefully denied it, but the exchange crystallized the political powder keg surrounding these files: Trump's own documented history with Epstein makes any AG's handling of the investigation inherently suspect to critics, while aggressive questioning from Democrats allows Republicans to frame transparency demands as partisan attacks.

## The International Dimension

The Epstein investigation has now formally crossed into international diplomacy. **Lord Peter Mandelson**, former British EU commissioner and recently the UK's ambassador to the United States, has been formally requested to testify before Congress about his relationship with Epstein. According to The Guardian, **Rep. Robert Garcia**, ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, and **Rep. Suhas Subramanyam** wrote to Mandelson stating it is "clear" he "holds critical information" relevant to their investigation.

[Previous reporting](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) indicated Mandelson's name appears repeatedly in Epstein's correspondence and calendars. The request for his testimony marks an aggressive expansion of congressional oversight into foreign government officials—though Mandelson's role ended when the UK government recently replaced him as ambassador.

The Mandelson case illustrates how Epstein cultivated relationships across international power structures, not just American ones. His network included Middle Eastern royalty (Sulayem), European political figures (Mandelson), and institutions like the Nobel Committee—where [chairman Thorbjørn Jagland reportedly received gifts from Epstein](/articles/2026-02-13-nobel-chief-jagland-got-gifts-from-epstein-emails-reveal), according to released emails.

These international connections demonstrate what journalist **Anand Giridharadas** described in a New York Times interview this week as "the infrastructure of Jeffrey Epstein's power." Epstein wasn't simply a wealthy predator operating alone. He was a connector, a broker of influence across sectors and nations. The files reveal an elaborate system of relationships that gave him access, protection, and—until his arrest—effective immunity from consequences.

## The Pattern Behind the Names

Six weeks after the [Epstein Transparency Act became law](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), what picture emerges from the accumulating revelations? The names span finance ([Goldman Sachs executives](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files)), academia ([college presidents and professors](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout)), global shipping (Sulayem), elite law firms (Karp), media (Piers Morgan appeared [29 times](/articles/2026-02-13-piers-morgan-named-29-times-in-epstein-files-here-s-what-we-found)), and entertainment (Joe Rogan's [name appeared](/articles/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-addresses-name-in-epstein-files-release), though in what context remains unclear).

But frequency of mention alone doesn't indicate culpability. This is the central challenge in interpreting the files: Epstein documented everything. His calendars included lunch meetings, phone calls, introductions, and correspondence with hundreds of individuals, many of whom may have had limited, professional, or even unwitting interactions with him. The files contain both genuinely compromising material and mundane administrative records.

Context is everything. [Prince Andrew's correspondence](/articles/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface) directly contradicts his BBC interview claims, suggesting consciousness of guilt. **Les Wexner**, the billionaire [labeled a "co-conspirator" by Rep. Khanna](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-reveals-6-named-in-epstein-files-labels-wexner-co-conspirator), gave Epstein power of attorney over his finances and a Manhattan mansion—an extraordinary transfer of control that demands explanation. These cases differ fundamentally from someone whose name appears because they attended the same conference or sat on an airplane.

The [Bank of America lawsuit](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed) allowed to proceed by a federal court this week alleges the bank facilitated Epstein's trafficking operation by processing suspicious transactions and ignoring red flags. If proven, it would establish institutional complicity beyond individual associations—financial infrastructure that enabled criminal activity.

## The Infrastructure of Elite Immunity

The Times interview with Giridharadas examines how elite networks create protective infrastructure around their members. Epstein leveraged his connections for access and protection. When questions arose about his activities, he could call on powerful friends. When legal troubles emerged, elite attorneys represented him. When he negotiated the infamous 2008 non-prosecution agreement in Florida, federal prosecutors deferred to his legal team in ways unimaginable for ordinary defendants.

This infrastructure explains why Epstein's activities continued for years despite repeated allegations. It wasn't a conspiracy in the conventional sense—no shadowy cabal meeting in secret. It was something more banal and more insidious: a class of people who reflexively protect each other, who see questioning one member's conduct as threatening the entire ecosystem of privilege and access.

The files expose this infrastructure in granular detail. They show who called whom, who made introductions, who attended gatherings, who corresponded about "opportunities" and "investments." Read individually, many of these interactions seem innocuous. Read collectively, they map a network of mutual benefit that placed Epstein at its center.

## What the DOJ Won't Say

Despite weeks of releases, major questions remain unanswered. The FBI has [explained some redactions](/articles/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) as protecting ongoing investigations, victim privacy, and intelligence sources. Those justifications have merit in specific cases. But they don't explain the [Trump DOJ's blanket resistance](/articles/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) to more comprehensive disclosure.

At the Wednesday hearing, lawmakers asked Bondi pointed questions: Who else faces potential prosecution? What happened to the dozens of women and girls Epstein's co-conspirators allegedly trafficked? Why hasn't Ghislaine Maxwell's client list been released? Bondi provided few substantive answers, repeatedly citing ongoing investigations she could not discuss publicly.

The "ongoing investigation" defense grows less credible with time. Epstein died in 2019. Maxwell was convicted in 2021. If prosecutors had sufficient evidence to charge additional conspirators, why haven't they? If they lack evidence, why continue suggesting they might charge someone eventually?

The most cynical interpretation holds that DOJ maintains the fiction of ongoing investigation to justify withholding documents that would embarrass powerful people—including potentially Trump himself, whose relationship with Epstein remains partially documented in the files. A more charitable reading suggests prosecutors face genuine challenges: witnesses who won't cooperate, statutes of limitations that have expired, and evidence that shows bad judgment rather than prosecutable crimes.

Both explanations may be partially true. But neither justifies the blanket resistance to disclosure that has characterized DOJ's approach.

## The Political Fracture

Perhaps the most unexpected development has been conservative backlash against Bondi and, implicitly, Trump's handling of the Epstein matter. Axios reports prominent MAGA figures calling for Bondi's removal—a stunning breach in typically unified Trump coalition politics. The fracture reveals competing priorities within the movement: loyalty to Trump versus demand for accountability, institutional trust versus anti-establishment suspicion.

Some Trump supporters see Epstein transparency as a weapon against the liberal establishment and want maximum disclosure regardless of where it leads. Others recognize that Trump's own documented relationship with Epstein creates political vulnerability and prefer the issue disappear. Still others genuinely believe in transparency as a principle, even when it complicates their political objectives.

The internal MAGA conflict gives Democrats an opening but also a dilemma. Pursuing Epstein files too aggressively risks appearing partisan, particularly when figures like Khanna apparently misidentify names. But backing off allows DOJ to slow-walk disclosure indefinitely. University of Virginia political analyst **Larry Sabato** called the Epstein files a "festering sore" for Trump—one that won't heal without either full transparency or successful suppression.

## What Comes Next

The immediate future likely includes continued congressional pressure, more corporate casualties as additional names surface, and ongoing legal battles over disclosure. [Congress has subpoenaed Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify in Ohio about his relationship with Epstein and the extraordinary financial control he granted. His testimony, if it occurs, could provide the most significant public accounting yet from someone at the center of Epstein's operation.

The [New York Times has launched a major investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into millions of pages of Epstein documents. Investigative journalism may ultimately provide more answers than congressional hearings or DOJ disclosures, as reporters aren't bound by classification rules or political calculation.

But the fundamental tension remains unresolved: the public's right to know versus legitimate privacy and investigative interests. Not everyone named in the Epstein files deserves public exposure. Some are victims. Some are minor figures whose tangential connections tell us nothing important. Some appear in documents because Epstein name-dropped them without their knowledge.

The challenge is developing a framework for disclosure that distinguishes between these categories—one that protects the innocent while exposing those who enabled, benefited from, or participated in Epstein's activities. Right now, we have neither full transparency nor thoughtful curation. We have selective leaks, political grandstanding, and an attorney general accused of spying on the lawmakers trying to investigate.

The Epstein scandal has exposed more than individual misconduct. It has revealed how elite networks function, how institutional power protects itself, and how governmental secrecy enables both. These files document not just crimes, but a system that allowed those crimes to continue for decades while powerful men looked away—or participated.

That system still exists. The files prove it. What remains uncertain is whether their release will lead to meaningful accountability or simply confirm what many already suspected: that different rules apply to the powerful, and transparency remains something they grant rather than something we can demand.
