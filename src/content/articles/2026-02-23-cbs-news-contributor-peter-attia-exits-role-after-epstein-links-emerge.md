## Broader Fallout From Epstein Files

Attia's exit is part of a [broader wave of resignations](/news/2026-02-17-full-list-of-politicians-royals-named-in-epstein-files-released) following the DOJ document release. Other media and business figures have faced professional consequences after being named in Epstein-related files.

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had previously been convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida, serving 13 months under a controversial plea agreement.

The [FBI began reviewing](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) Epstein-related records under the Transparency Act, which Congress passed in 2024. The law requires federal agencies to declassify and release documents about Epstein's activities and associates.

Court documents, flight logs, and other records have identified numerous individuals who had contact with Epstein during his years as a financier and socialite before his 2019 death.
