## Lawmakers Demand Full File Release

Democratic members of Congress who invited the victims are demanding the full release of Epstein-related files, according to the Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Epstein Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law in January, requires federal agencies to declassify and release documents related to Epstein within 180 days, with limited exceptions for national security concerns.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The law passed the House of Representatives 382-34 in December and cleared the Senate unanimously before Trump signed it. The FBI began its formal review of Epstein-related records following the law's enactment.

Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) [claimed the Department of Justice withheld certain documents](/news/2026-02-24-rep-garcia-doj-withheld-fbi-interviews-with-trump-accuser-in-epstein-files), including FBI interviews with a Trump accuser, from an initial document release in January.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> [Rep.

## Epstein Case Background

Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan federal jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner. Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida on state charges of soliciting a minor as part of a plea deal that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The law includes provisions allowing agencies to redact or withhold information that could compromise national security, ongoing investigations, or the privacy of victims.
