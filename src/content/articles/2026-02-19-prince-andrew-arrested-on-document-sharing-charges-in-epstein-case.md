A member of the British royal family has been arrested for the first time in modern history. **Prince Andrew**, the younger brother of **King Charles III**, was taken into police custody on **Thursday, February 19, 2026**, on suspicion of sharing sensitive government documents with convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The arrest follows revelations in recently released Epstein files and marks an unprecedented moment for the monarchy. Andrew, who was stripped of his royal titles and military affiliations in 2022, now faces potential charges of misconduct in public office.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

King Charles III released a statement Thursday saying "the law must take its course" following his brother's arrest.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Prince Andrew has denied any wrongdoing.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## The Charges and Investigation

The arrest stems from suspected misconduct in public office revealed in the Jeffrey Epstein files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> According to Courthouse News, the former prince is suspected of sharing sensitive documents with Epstein during the period when Andrew held official government positions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The investigation represents "further fallout from the Epstein files," which have continued to implicate prominent figures in their association with the financier.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Prince Andrew served as the United Kingdom's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment from 2001 to 2011, a role that gave him access to government information and brought him into contact with business leaders worldwide. During this period, Andrew was photographed with Epstein on multiple occasions, including after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

## Royal Family Response

King Charles's statement that "the law must take its course" represents the official position of Buckingham Palace on the arrest.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> **Julian Payne**, CBS News royal contributor and former communications director for King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, provided analysis of how the royal family is responding to the situation.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

In January 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped Andrew of his military titles and royal patronages following a civil lawsuit filed by **Virginia Giuffre**, who alleged that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17 after being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew settled that lawsuit in February 2022 without admitting liability.

## International Implications

The Bureau reported that China ties "cast shadow over investigation" into Andrew's arrest.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The publication also noted potential implications for **Prime Minister Keir Starmer's** government.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Historical Significance

The arrest marks what Courthouse News described as "a historic first for a senior royal."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> No member of the immediate royal family in modern British history has previously been taken into police custody on criminal suspicions.

Misconduct in public office is a common law offense in England and Wales that can carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, though sentences vary widely based on the circumstances of each case.

## Next Steps

As of Thursday afternoon, Prince Andrew remained in custody. The Crown Prosecution Service will review the evidence gathered by investigators and determine whether formal charges are warranted.
