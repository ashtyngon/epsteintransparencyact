Dr. Peter Attia has departed his position as a medical contributor at CBS News following the revelation that his name appeared in court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and public criticism from comedian John Oliver, IMDb reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The exit comes after Attia's name surfaced in unsealed court files connected to the Epstein case and Oliver addressed Attia on his HBO program.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Attia's Media and Medical Background

Attia had served as a medical contributor for CBS News, where he provided health and wellness analysis. He is a physician who trained at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Stanford University Medical Center, specializing in longevity medicine and metabolic health.

He hosts "The Drive," a podcast focused on health optimization, which has gained a significant following in wellness circles. His work focuses on extending lifespan and improving healthspan through nutrition, exercise, and preventive medicine strategies.

CBS News has not publicly commented on the circumstances of Attia's departure or disclosed details about the nature of his inclusion in the Epstein-related court documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Court Document Releases

The unsealing of Epstein-related court documents has identified numerous individuals from business, media, entertainment, and other sectors who had varying degrees of connection to Epstein. Inclusion in court files does not indicate wrongdoing, as the documents contain correspondence, flight logs, address books, and other records from civil litigation and criminal investigations.

The documents stem from multiple legal proceedings, including a 2015 defamation lawsuit and federal criminal cases. Federal agencies continue to process document releases under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which mandates review and declassification of Epstein-related records.

The [FBI has begun reviewing its records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) related to Epstein investigations as required by the legislation.

Epstein died in August 2019 in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida, a plea agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution at that time.

[Multiple high-profile figures have resigned](/news/2026-02-17-full-list-of-politicians-royals-named-in-epstein-files-released) from positions after being named in released Epstein files, though the specific nature and context of inclusions varies widely across different documents.

Oliver's public commentary about Attia occurred on his weekly HBO program, though the specific content of those remarks has not been detailed in available reporting.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
