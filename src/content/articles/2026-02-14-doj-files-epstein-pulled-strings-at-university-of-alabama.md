Jeffrey Epstein helped arrange a guest speaker for the University of Alabama, according to Department of Justice records reported by WVTM.

The DOJ files allege Epstein facilitated the speaker arrangement, though details about when this occurred, who at the university was involved, and the identity of the speaker have not been disclosed.

The revelation places Alabama on the growing list of academic institutions whose Epstein connections have surfaced since the Epstein Transparency Act forced the release of millions of pages of documents. [College presidents and professors at multiple universities](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) have already faced scrutiny after being named in the files.

## Beyond the Ivy League

Universities became critical to Epstein's strategy for building legitimacy. He poured money into MIT, Harvard, and other elite institutions, gaining access to faculty and the social credibility that academic partnerships provided.

The Alabama connection suggests his influence reached beyond the coastal universities where he cultivated his image as a science philanthropist. Arranging speakers—connecting institutions with prominent figures—was a low-cost way to make himself valuable to administrators while expanding his network.

The University of Alabama has not publicly addressed the DOJ records.

## A Pattern of Access

Epstein's method was consistent: offer connections, donations, or introductions to high-profile individuals, then extract legitimacy and access in return. University administrators often accepted the help without asking hard questions about who they were dealing with.

Congressional investigators have subpoenaed multiple figures with academic ties to testify about their Epstein relationships, including [billionaire Les Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and [Lord Mandelson](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe).

Each document release expands the map of institutions that gave Epstein a foothold. Universities that accepted his help now face questions about whether their vetting failures provided cover for a serial predator—and why so many were willing to take his calls in the first place.
