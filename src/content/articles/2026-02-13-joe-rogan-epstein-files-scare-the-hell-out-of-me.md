Joe Rogan said the Epstein files **"scare the s--- out of me"** and called them **"definitely not a hoax"** during his podcast this week.

**"This is the one that I hate the most,"** Rogan told Black Rifle Coffee Company chair Evan Hafer, according to The Hill.

The comments came days after [Rogan addressed his own name appearing in the files](/articles/2026-02-13-joe-rogan-epstein-files-scare-the-hell-out-of-me). Rogan hosts one of the most-listened-to podcasts in the world.

## Why It Matters

Rogan's reaction—broadcast to millions of listeners—comes as documents continue to reveal a network of powerful people connected to a convicted sex trafficker.

The files have already forced out [Goldman Sachs top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files), a former White House counsel, and [DP World chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem](/articles/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), who appeared more than 4,700 times in the documents. Congress has subpoenaed [billionaire Leslie Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), Epstein's only confirmed financial client, and [Lord Mandelson](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe), the former UK ambassador. Rep. [Thomas Massie named six men on the House floor](/articles/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) whose identities remain officially redacted.

Attorney General Pam Bondi continues facing pressure over [why so much remains hidden](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release), even as the [DOJ tracks which lawmakers are searching the files](/articles/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches).

Rogan's comments reflect growing public attention to the Epstein files and the ongoing debate over full document disclosure.
