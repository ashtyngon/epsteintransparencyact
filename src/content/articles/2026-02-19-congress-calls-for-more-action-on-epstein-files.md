Congressional lawmakers called for additional arrests following the detention of former Prince Andrew in the United Kingdom on charges related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, according to multiple members of Congress who spoke publicly on Thursday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The calls came as political figures across the United States responded to Andrew's arrest, which occurred earlier this week in connection with document-sharing allegations tied to the Epstein case.

Several members of Congress stated that Andrew's arrest should not mark the end of accountability in the Epstein matter.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The lawmakers did not specify additional individuals they believed should face charges, but their statements came amid ongoing scrutiny of individuals connected to the late financier.

The arrest of the former British royal has prompted renewed focus on American figures with documented connections to Epstein, including prominent business leaders and politicians who appeared in court documents and flight logs associated with the convicted sex offender.

## Congressional Response to International Arrest

Members of Congress issued statements Thursday calling for further action following Andrew's detention by UK authorities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The arrest represents the first detention of a high-profile figure directly connected to Epstein since the passage of federal transparency legislation aimed at compelling disclosure of government records related to the case.

The lawmakers' statements did not outline specific investigative steps they planned to pursue or identify individuals they believed warranted prosecution.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The calls for additional arrests came as Congress continues to receive documents under the Epstein Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this year.

Prince Andrew was arrested on charges related to alleged document sharing in the Epstein investigation, according to previous reports.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> UK authorities have not released details about the specific nature of the documents or the circumstances of the alleged sharing.

## Republican Questions Epstein Death Finding

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene questioned the official determination that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in a federal detention facility in 2019.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The Georgia Republican rejected findings by the Department of Justice under the Trump administration that Epstein's death resulted from suicide.

Greene's statement came as part of broader congressional discussion about the Epstein case following Andrew's arrest.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The DOJ's inspector general concluded in 2020 that Epstein died by suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, though the report identified multiple failures by Bureau of Prisons staff in preventing the death.

The congressman did not cite new evidence to support her questioning of the official finding.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10, 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

## Ohio Governor Defends Wexner Amid Epstein Scrutiny

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine expressed support for billionaire Leslie Wexner despite the businessman's documented ties to Jeffrey Epstein, according to statements DeWine made Thursday.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The Republican governor's comments came during a press appearance where he declined to defend Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

DeWine stated he supported Wexner, the founder of L Brands and a prominent Ohio business figure.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Court documents and previous reporting have established that Wexner had financial and business relationships with Epstein spanning multiple years, including granting Epstein power of attorney over his financial affairs.

The governor did not elaborate on the basis for his continued support or address specific allegations about Wexner's relationship with Epstein.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Wexner has previously stated that Epstein misappropriated millions of dollars from him and that he severed ties with Epstein in 2007.

DeWine's office did not immediately respond to questions about whether the governor had reviewed recent testimony or documents related to Wexner's connection to Epstein.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Local officials in New Albany, Ohio, where Wexner maintains significant business interests, have called for greater transparency about the relationship between the billionaire and Epstein.

## Political Divides Over Epstein Investigation

The responses from lawmakers and state officials Thursday highlighted continuing political divisions over how aggressively to pursue individuals connected to Epstein.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The Hill reported that fallout from the Epstein case intensified following Andrew's arrest, with lawmakers split over next steps in the investigation.

Some members of Congress have called for comprehensive release of all government documents related to Epstein, while others have expressed concern about protecting the privacy of individuals mentioned in files who may not face criminal allegations.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The debate has occurred as federal agencies continue reviewing records under the transparency law passed by Congress.

The FBI began its review of Epstein-related records following the law's enactment, though the agency has not announced a timeline for releasing documents to the public.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Congressional oversight committees have received some materials related to the investigation, but the full scope of government records remains unclear.

## Continuing Congressional Oversight

Congressional committees have indicated they will continue oversight of the Epstein matter as documents become available under the transparency law.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Committee chairs have not announced specific hearings or investigative timelines following Andrew's arrest.

The calls for additional arrests came as lawmakers from both parties face questions about their own connections to individuals in Epstein's network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Multiple current and former members of Congress appeared in flight logs or other documents associated with Epstein, though appearance in such records does not necessarily indicate wrongdoing or knowledge of criminal activity.

No members of Congress have been charged with crimes related to Epstein, and most who have been asked about connections have stated they had minimal contact with the financier or were unaware of his criminal conduct.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The extent of congressional knowledge about Epstein's activities prior to his 2019 arrest remains a subject of ongoing scrutiny.

Federal prosecutors have not announced new charges against any U.S. citizens following the latest release of Epstein-related files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Department of Justice has not commented on whether active investigations continue into individuals connected to Epstein beyond those already charged or convicted.
