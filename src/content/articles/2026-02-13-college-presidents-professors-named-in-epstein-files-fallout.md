Colleges and universities are scrambling to contain damage from the Epstein files, with university presidents and multiple professors now revealed to have maintained ties to the convicted sex trafficker. The fallout extends from Harvard and MIT to Ohio State and Bard College, forcing institutions to confront financial and personal relationships they tried to leave in the past.

**Harvard University** accepted $9.1 million from Epstein and allowed him to visit campus at least 40 times after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Faculty who met with Epstein included former Treasury Secretary **Lawrence Summers**, who served as Harvard's president from 2001 to 2006, and evolutionary biologist **Martin Nowak**, who ran the Epstein-funded Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. Cognitive scientist **Steven Pinker** also appeared in connection with Epstein visits to campus.

At **MIT**, the fallout was equally severe. Media Lab director **Joi Ito** resigned in 2019 after investigative reporting revealed that Epstein donated $850,000 to the university and that Ito had concealed the relationship. MIT professor **Seth Lloyd** received a $225,000 personal research grant from Epstein.

**Bard College** president **Leon Botstein** appeared in Epstein's personal contacts, extending scrutiny beyond elite research universities to smaller liberal arts colleges.

At **Ohio State University**, the connection runs through **Les Wexner**, Epstein's only confirmed financial client and the university's largest donor. The Wexner Medical Center bears his name, and students have called for the building to be renamed.

## Investigations Underway

Universities are facing calls for more than vague promises to "review" the matter. Student groups want names, dates, and dollar amounts—full transparency about which faculty members maintained relationships with Epstein and which administrators knew about it.

Harvard conducted an internal review in 2020 that acknowledged Epstein's campus visits but did not discipline any faculty. Critics called the review insufficient. MIT's own investigation led to policy changes but no faculty terminations beyond Ito's resignation.

Some schools are citing the need for "thorough internal reviews" before taking action. That deliberate pace is being criticized by advocates who point out these institutions have had years to investigate and have not yet taken public action.

## The Prestige Exchange

Epstein funded research programs, endowed faculty positions, and used those connections to build intellectual respectability. At Harvard alone, his $9.1 million funded the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, giving him a direct line to faculty and a veneer of academic legitimacy. At MIT, the $850,000 in donations bought access to the Media Lab's cutting-edge research and its network of corporate sponsors.

Universities that accepted his money now face scrutiny over their role in enabling a sex trafficker through continued financial relationships. Administrators are also fielding questions about due diligence—specifically, why faculty and administrators continued working with Epstein after his criminal history became public in 2008.

The academic fallout adds another dimension to [the broader Epstein files release](/articles/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents), which has already forced [resignations on Wall Street](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) and exposed [financial institutions' ties to trafficking operations](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed).

Student groups and advocacy organizations are calling on universities to provide full accountings of their financial and institutional relationships with Epstein, including a complete list of donations received, campus visits logged, and faculty who maintained contact after his conviction.
