Colleges and universities are scrambling to contain damage from the Epstein files, with at least one sitting university president and multiple professors now revealed to have maintained ties to the convicted sex trafficker.

The fallout spans from state schools to Ivy League institutions. Administrators have launched internal investigations into faculty connections, while students and advocacy groups demand buildings be renamed and institutional ties severed.

The document releases show the extent to which Epstein embedded himself in academic circles, using donations and social connections to build relationships at elite universities. Records show some faculty and administrators continued working with Epstein after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, and institutions continued accepting his money.

## Investigations Underway

Universities are facing calls for more than vague promises to "review" the matter. Student groups want names, dates, and dollar amounts—full transparency about which faculty members maintained relationships with Epstein and which administrators knew about it.

Some schools are citing the need for "thorough internal reviews" before taking action. That deliberate pace is being criticized by advocates who point out these institutions have had years to investigate and have not yet taken public action.

## The Prestige Exchange

Epstein funded research programs, endowed faculty positions, and used those connections to build intellectual respectability. Universities that accepted his money now face scrutiny over their role in enabling a sex trafficker through continued financial relationships.

Administrators are also fielding questions about due diligence. Multiple faculty members maintained professional relationships with Epstein after his criminal history became public. The nature of those continued relationships has not been publicly explained by the universities involved.

The academic fallout adds another dimension to [the broader Epstein files release](/articles/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents), which has already forced [resignations on Wall Street](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) and exposed [financial institutions' ties to trafficking operations](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed).

Student groups and advocacy organizations are calling on universities to provide full accountings of their financial and institutional relationships with Epstein.
