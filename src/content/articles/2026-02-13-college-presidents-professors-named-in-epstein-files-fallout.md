Colleges and universities are scrambling to contain damage from the Epstein files, with university presidents and multiple professors now revealed to have maintained ties to the convicted sex trafficker. The fallout extends from Harvard and MIT to Ohio State and Bard College, forcing institutions to confront financial and personal relationships they tried to leave in the past.

**Harvard University** accepted $9.1 million from Epstein and allowed him to visit campus at least 40 times after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Faculty who met with Epstein included former Treasury Secretary **Lawrence Summers**, who served as Harvard's president from 2001 to 2006, and evolutionary biologist **Martin Nowak**, who ran the Epstein-funded Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. Cognitive scientist **Steven Pinker** also appeared in connection with Epstein visits to campus.

At **MIT**, the fallout was equally severe. Media Lab director **Joi Ito** resigned in 2019 after internal documents showed he helped Epstein donate $1.7 million to the lab while concealing the financier's identity from university officials. Ito also accepted $1.2 million from Epstein for his personal investment funds. MIT professor **Seth Lloyd** received a $225,000 personal research grant from Epstein. MIT President L. Rafael Reif later apologized for the institution's handling of Epstein donations, calling it "a collective and significant failure of judgment."

**Bard College** president **Leon Botstein** invited Epstein to campus twice in 2013 and met with him in New York at least four times between 2012 and 2015. Botstein told the New York Times he was "completely unaware" of the nature of Epstein's crimes.

At **Ohio State University**, the connection runs through **Les Wexner**, Epstein's only confirmed financial client and the university's largest donor. The Wexner Medical Center bears his name, and students have called for the building to be renamed.

## Columbia University: Admissions Corruption and Survivor Exploitation

**Columbia University** has emerged as one of the most deeply implicated institutions. The DOJ files and a congressional inquiry led by Rep. Jamie Raskin revealed multiple layers of Epstein's influence at the university.

Nobel laureate **Dr. Richard Axel**, a Columbia neuroscience professor and 2004 Nobel Prize winner, was a close friend of Epstein for 11 years and was invited to Epstein's private island in 2011 — three years after Epstein's conviction. Axel also lobbied Columbia admissions on Epstein's behalf. Columbia acknowledged the relationship and said Axel called it "a serious error in judgment."

The most damaging revelation involved admissions corruption. Epstein's last known girlfriend, **Karyna Shuliak**, was rejected from Columbia's College of Dental Medicine in February 2012. Within three months, she was admitted as an international transfer student after Epstein leveraged multiple Columbia figures — including **Dr. Thomas Magnani**, a dental school faculty member, and **Dr. Letty Moss-Salentijn**, vice dean of the dental school. Epstein paid Shuliak's tuition and had his accountant send $100,000 to Columbia's School of Public Health. Columbia subsequently removed Magnani from the admissions committee and terminated his faculty appointment, and required Moss-Salentijn to step down from administrative roles.

Perhaps most seriously, Raskin's January 2026 letter to Columbia revealed survivor testimony that Epstein repeatedly lured young women by promising to get them into the university. Between 2004 and 2007, Epstein paid for at least one survivor he had abused to attend Columbia as an undergraduate, making tuition payments in excess of actual costs so the survivor would receive thousands of dollars directly from the university — creating financial dependency. Epstein's COUQ Foundation documented over $200,000 in scholarship payments to Columbia, NYU, and Hunter College between 2001 and 2006.

Columbia identified $210,000 in Epstein-related donations and pledged to donate $105,000 each to two nonprofits supporting survivors.

## Investigations Underway

Universities are facing calls for more than vague promises to "review" the matter. Student groups want names, dates, and dollar amounts — full transparency about which faculty members maintained relationships with Epstein and which administrators knew about it.

Harvard conducted an internal review in 2020 that acknowledged Epstein's campus visits but did not discipline any faculty. Critics called the review insufficient. MIT's own investigation led to policy changes but no faculty terminations beyond Ito's resignation. Columbia's response has been criticized for focusing on the dental school admissions scandal while ignoring the survivor testimony about Epstein using the university as a tool for trafficking.

Some schools are citing the need for "thorough internal reviews" before taking action. That deliberate pace is being criticized by advocates who point out these institutions have had years to investigate and have not yet taken public action.

## "Social Cover"

In a 2014 email to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein wrote that his university connections provided "social cover" and helped him "seem legitimate," according to the New York Times.

Ruth Simmons, former president of Brown University, served on Epstein's foundation board in 2000 but resigned before his first arrest in 2006.

## The Prestige Exchange

Epstein funded research programs, endowed faculty positions, corrupted admissions processes, and used those connections to build intellectual respectability — and, in Columbia's case, to lure and control trafficking victims. At Harvard alone, his $9.1 million funded the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, giving him a direct line to faculty and a veneer of academic legitimacy. At MIT, the $850,000 in donations bought access to the Media Lab's cutting-edge research and its network of corporate sponsors. At Columbia, he leveraged Nobel Prize connections and admissions access to maintain influence while using tuition payments as a mechanism of control over survivors.

Universities that accepted his money now face scrutiny over their role in enabling a sex trafficker through continued financial relationships. Administrators are also fielding questions about due diligence — specifically, why faculty and administrators continued working with Epstein after his criminal history became public in 2008.

The academic fallout adds another dimension to [the broader Epstein files release](/news/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents), which has already forced [resignations on Wall Street](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) and exposed [financial institutions' ties to trafficking operations](/news/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed).

Student groups and advocacy organizations are calling on universities to provide full accountings of their financial and institutional relationships with Epstein, including a complete list of donations received, campus visits logged, and faculty who maintained contact after his conviction.
