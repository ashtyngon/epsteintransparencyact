Friends and family of Jonathan Lee Riches, the man shot and killed by Secret Service agents after breaching security at Mar-a-Lago on January 28, say he had become deeply focused on the Jeffrey Epstein case in the months before his death, according to Salon.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Riches, described by those close to him as a "good kid," had been poring over the Epstein files that were released to the public, friends and family told Salon.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His preoccupation with the case intensified in the period leading up to the incident at former President Donald Trump's Florida estate.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Secret Service agents fatally shot Riches after he breached the perimeter of Mar-a-Lago carrying a firearm.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The incident occurred while Trump was in residence at the property.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Epstein Documents Found in Vehicle

Former FBI agent Maureen O'Connell told media outlets that materials related to Epstein were found in Riches' vehicle after the shooting.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Salon's reporting focuses on statements from friends and family about his engagement with publicly available Epstein files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Those who knew Riches said his interest in the Epstein case had consumed much of his attention in recent months.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The timing coincided with ongoing document releases related to Epstein's sex trafficking operation and his connections to prominent figures.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Court-ordered releases of documents from civil litigation involving Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell have continued to emerge over the past two years, naming numerous individuals who had contact with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Security Breach Details

Secret Service protocols mandate the use of lethal force when an armed individual breaches secure perimeters where protectees are present.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Mar-a-Lago functions as both a private residence and a members-only club.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Public engagement with Epstein-related document releases has been substantial since courts began unsealing materials from civil litigation. The files have revealed the extent of Epstein's social connections and prompted renewed scrutiny of individuals whose names appear in flight logs, visitor records, and witness testimony.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Jeffrey Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2025, mandated the declassification and public release of all federal documents related to Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The full release process is ongoing.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 after his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her role in his trafficking operation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
