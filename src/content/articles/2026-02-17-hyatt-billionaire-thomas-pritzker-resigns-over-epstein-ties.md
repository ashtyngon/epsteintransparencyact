Thomas Pritzker resigned from the board of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, citing his contact with Jeffrey Epstein as the reason for his departure.

"I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner," Pritzker said in a statement.

His statement did not specify when his contact with Epstein began or ended, what their interactions involved, or whether they included business dealings. Pritzker also did not say whether he has been contacted by law enforcement.

## The Pritzker Name and Hyatt

The Pritzker family founded Hyatt in 1957 and ranks among the wealthiest families in the United States. Thomas Pritzker had served as executive chairman of the hospitality company, which now operates more than 1,300 properties in 70 countries.

His cousin, J.B. Pritzker, serves as governor of Illinois. The family's holdings extend beyond hotels to manufacturing, real estate, and private equity.

Hyatt announced that Pritzker's board position would remain vacant pending a search for his replacement. The company thanked him for his service but did not address whether the board had prior knowledge of his contact with Epstein.

## Third Major Executive Resignation

The resignation follows the release of Department of Justice files that named Pritzker among hundreds of individuals who had documented contact with Epstein.

The DOJ files show Epstein maintained contact with dozens of business leaders, politicians, and academics even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. [Multiple lawmakers have disputed the DOJ's claim](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows) that all relevant files have been released.

Pritzker's one-sentence statement offered no explanation for how he came to know Epstein, whether their contact was social or professional, or how frequently they communicated. The lack of detail mirrors statements from other executives who have resigned or faced scrutiny since the files became public.
