Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem resigned immediately as chair and CEO of DP World on Friday after emails surfaced linking him to Jeffrey Epstein. The company, which owns P&O Ferries and operates ports and logistics globally, said it was forced to take action following pressure over the revelations.

DP World, a Dubai-based conglomerate ultimately owned by the emirate's royal family, announced the departure in a brief statement. The company did not disclose what the emails contained, the nature of bin Sulayem's relationship with Epstein, or whether it conducted any internal investigation before his exit.

## Second Executive Out This Week

Bin Sulayem's resignation follows a pattern of corporate exits triggered by the latest Epstein document releases. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) earlier this week after emails revealed she called Epstein "uncle Jeffrey". Both departures happened within days of [a congressman naming six men](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-on-house-floor) whose identities had been redacted from official Epstein files.

The speed of bin Sulayem's exit—described as immediate—suggests either the content of the emails was indefensible or that Dubai's royal owners calculated any Epstein association had become a liability they couldn't afford.

## No Answers, No Accountability

Unlike public officials facing congressional scrutiny—[Les Wexner was subpoenaed](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about his decades-long ties to Epstein—private executives can resign without explaining what they knew, what they did, or how deep their connections ran.

DP World has not said whether bin Sulayem will retain other positions in Dubai's state-linked business apparatus. The company has not named an interim replacement or addressed how his departure affects operations at one of the world's largest port operators.

The emails that triggered his resignation remain undisclosed. So does any explanation of why a senior executive at a royal family-owned enterprise was corresponding with a convicted sex trafficker in the first place.
