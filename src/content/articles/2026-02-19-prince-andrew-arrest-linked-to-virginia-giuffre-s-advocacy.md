Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's Thursday arrest marks him as the highest-profile figure to face criminal consequences for ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to Axios.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Supporters of the late Virginia Giuffre see the arrest as a long-coming victory for the woman who once sued Mountbatten-Windsor for sexual abuse.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Andrew's Denials

Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied wrongdoing in connection with his relationship with Epstein, according to Axios.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Giuffre previously filed a civil lawsuit against Mountbatten-Windsor alleging sexual abuse.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She was among the most prominent alleged victims to publicly identify Epstein and individuals in his social circle.

The arrest follows years of scrutiny over [Mountbatten-Windsor's ties to Epstein](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-in-london-over-epstein-documents), including questions about meetings and communications between the two men. [Police have expanded their investigation](/news/2026-02-22-police-widen-prince-andrew-investigation-after-epstein-files-arrest) after the latest document release showed the extent of communication between Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein.

[Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for a probe](/news/2026-02-22-gordon-brown-demands-probe-into-andrew-s-raf-base-epstein-meetings) into whether Epstein held meetings at Royal Air Force bases.
