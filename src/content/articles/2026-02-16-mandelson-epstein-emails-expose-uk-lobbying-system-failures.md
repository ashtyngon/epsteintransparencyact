**President Donald Trump** denied connections to convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein** in a statement released February 17, declaring he has "nothing to hide" regarding the released files. The denial comes as international investigations expand across multiple continents and U.S. lawmakers from both parties question the scope of document releases from the Department of Justice.

Trump's statement, reported by Open Magazine, marks his latest public response to the Epstein files controversy. The timing coincides with [Attorney General Pam Bondi's claim](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed) that DOJ released "all" Epstein files, a statement that [independent analysis suggests released only 2% of available documents](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows).

[Former President Bill Clinton accused the Trump DOJ of a cover-up](/news/2026-02-17-clinton-accuses-trump-doj-of-epstein-files-cover-up-in-bbc-interview) in a BBC interview last week. Trump's denial comes days after that allegation.

## UK Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

**Transparency International UK** released an analysis February 16 examining emails between **Peter Mandelson** and Epstein, questioning what the correspondence reveals about Britain's lobbying regulations. The anti-corruption organization's report focuses on systemic issues in British influence peddling exposed by the Epstein files.

Mandelson, a former European trade commissioner and UK cabinet minister, received a [congressional subpoena](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) earlier this month requiring testimony before U.S. lawmakers. The Transparency International analysis examines how existing UK lobbying laws failed to capture or regulate the type of access documented in the released emails.

The organization's review comes as [Prince Andrew faces renewed scrutiny](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew), with UK prosecutors stating "nobody is above the law" while police investigate the Duke of York's documented connections to Epstein. British police established a [national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to examine trafficking allegations related to UK nationals.

## Global Investigation Expansion

**France, the United Kingdom, and India** have opened formal inquiries into their nationals named in the Epstein files, according to The Independent's February 16 report. The international probes mark a sharp contrast to the U.S. approach, where [President Trump called for ending Epstein investigations](/news/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) last week.

**French prosecutors** announced February 15 they would [investigate a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) identified in the documents. France [established a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review files for French nationals, according to earlier reports.

**India** opened investigations into [a businessman, minister, and guru](/news/2026-02-14-indian-businessman-minister-guru-named-in-epstein-files) named in the files, Indian media reported February 14. The Independent confirmed Indian authorities launched formal proceedings targeting these three individuals.

European officials have faced immediate consequences. The [Dubai ports chief resigned](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails surfaced. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named. These resignations contrast with U.S. patterns, where an analysis found [European elites toppled while U.S. officials retained power](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-files-topple-european-elites-while-u-s-officials-keep-power).

## Minnesota and Iowa Congressional Response

Federal lawmakers representing **Minnesota and Iowa** have yet to commit to reviewing unredacted Epstein files available to members of Congress, according to KTTC's February 16 report. The station contacted congressional offices from both states regarding their plans to access documents in secure facilities.

The report examined whether senators and representatives from the region would join colleagues like [Rep. Thomas Massie](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) and [Rep. Nancy Mace](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files) who demanded full access to unredacted materials. Massie declared ["I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) February 14 as pressure mounted over his advocacy for complete file releases.

Congressional access to unredacted files exists through secure reading rooms, but KTTC found no confirmation that Minnesota or Iowa delegations planned to utilize this access. [Rep. Ro Khanna blasted DOJ](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) for protecting "predators" through redactions, demanding transparency from the Justice Department.

DOJ officials provided [explanations for continued redactions](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted), citing ongoing investigations and victim privacy. However, [experts warned](/news/2026-02-14-expert-warns-raw-epstein-file-release-could-harm-ongoing-investigations) that raw file releases could compromise active cases.

## Domestic Investigations and Congressional Action

**New Mexico** launched the [first full investigation](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) into Epstein's Zorro Ranch February 17, according to state officials. The 8,000-acre property near Stanley, New Mexico became the subject of state-level scrutiny after federal documents revealed activities at the location.

The ranch's current ownership created political complications in Texas, where GOP candidate **Don Huffines**' family purchased the property for **$13.4 million**. [Texas Republicans expressed alarm](/news/2026-02-15-texas-gop-alarmed-over-comptroller-candidate-s-epstein-ranch-purchase) over Huffines' comptroller candidacy given his family's connection to the property.

Congressional subpoenas targeted major figures including [retail billionaire Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) and Mandelson. [Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner](/news/2026-02-14-ohio-politicians-received-campaign-funds-from-wexner), documents showed.

**United Nations experts** issued a February 16 statement [calling for investigation](/news/2026-02-16-un-experts-call-for-investigation-into-epstein-files-warn-of-crimes-against-huma) into the files and warning of potential crimes against humanity. The UN human rights officials urged member states to pursue accountability for documented abuses.

## Business and Academic Fallout

**Casey Wasserman**, head of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, faced calls to resign after Maxwell email revelations. The [LA Mayor demanded Wasserman step down](/news/2026-02-17-la-mayor-demands-olympic-chief-wasserman-step-down-over-maxwell-links) February 17. Wasserman previously [sold his sports agency](/news/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-agency-after-epstein-files-expose-ties) after the files exposed his connections.

**Hyatt heir Tom Pritzker** [stepped down](/news/2026-02-16-hyatt-heir-tom-pritzker-steps-down-over-epstein-contact-links) from corporate positions after files documented contact with Epstein. **Sarah Ferguson** announced the [closure of six companies](/news/2026-02-16-sarah-ferguson-shuts-down-6-companies-after-epstein-ties-exposed) after her Epstein connections emerged.

Academic institutions faced scrutiny as [college presidents and professors were named](/news/2026-02-16-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) in released documents. **Columbia University** [removed staff who facilitated](/news/2026-02-16-columbia-removes-staff-who-facilitated-epstein-linked-dental-admission) an Epstein-linked dental school admission. DOJ files showed [Epstein pulled strings at the University of Alabama](/news/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama).

**Leon Black**, the private equity billionaire named in files, saw schools [cancel photo day events](/news/2026-02-15-leon-black-named-in-epstein-files-schools-cancel-photo-day) bearing his family name. Documents revealed Black paid Epstein tens of millions for financial advice after Epstein's 2008 conviction.

## Political Tensions and Access Tools

**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** received [death threats](/news/2026-02-17-greene-faces-death-threats-over-trump-epstein-files-dispute) after criticizing Trump's handling of the files, according to her February 17 statement. Greene previously [blasted the release as a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) that damaged the administration.

Congressional hearings produced tense exchanges. Massie stated Bondi [avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) during testimony. The Kentucky Republican later said he [lost confidence in the Attorney General](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over the files dispute.

Technology platforms emerged to help researchers navigate released documents. [JeffTube](/news/2026-02-16-jefftube-new-platform-makes-doj-epstein-files-easier-to-browse), a new browser tool, launched February 16 to make DOJ files more accessible. The platform allows keyword searches across the released tranche.

[Ghislaine Maxwell offered to reveal "truth"](/news/2026-02-15-ghislaine-maxwell-offers-to-reveal-truth-in-exchange-for-clemency) in exchange for clemency, according to her attorney's February 15 statement. Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal sentence for sex trafficking.

## Next Steps

Congress continues reviewing released materials through secure facilities. [Rep. Mace pushed for judicial term limits](/news/2026-02-17-rep-mace-demands-full-epstein-files-transparency-pushes-judicial-term-limits) alongside her transparency demands, linking the Epstein case to broader institutional reform.

The New Mexico investigation represents the first state-level probe of the Zorro Ranch. Federal authorities hold [thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's island operation](/news/2026-02-16-fbi-holds-thousands-of-files-on-detroit-millionaire-s-island-operation) that remain unreleased.

International investigations proceed in France, the UK, and India. UK prosecutors emphasized accountability applies to all individuals regardless of status. French and Indian authorities have not announced timelines for completing their reviews.

Congressional subpoenas for Wexner and Mandelson testimony remain active. No hearing dates have been publicly announced for either witness.
