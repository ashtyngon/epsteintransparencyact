# Goldman Sachs Top Lawyer Resigns After DOJ Epstein Files Reveal Close Relationship

**Kathy Ruemmler**, Goldman Sachs' Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel, will resign following the Department of Justice's release of remaining files connected to convicted sex offender **Jeffrey Epstein** that revealed a close relationship between the two. Goldman Sachs CEO **David Solomon** announced Ruemmler's departure on **Thursday, February 12, 2026**.

The resignation comes as the DOJ released its final batch of Epstein-related documents, bringing renewed scrutiny to individuals who had associations with the convicted sex offender. Ruemmler's proximity to Epstein, as revealed in the newly released files, prompted her decision to step down from one of Wall Street's most prominent legal positions.

## Ruemmler's Position at Goldman Sachs

Ruemmler served as the investment banking company's top lawyer, holding the dual titles of Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel. Her departure represents a significant leadership change for Goldman Sachs, one of the world's largest investment banks.

The nature and extent of Ruemmler's relationship with Epstein, as documented in the DOJ files, was not detailed in the announcement. The DOJ document release represents the government's remaining files on Epstein, adding to previously disclosed materials related to his criminal activities and associates.

## Context of DOJ Epstein File Release

The Department of Justice's release of these files continues the ongoing process of transparency around Epstein's criminal network and his connections to prominent figures in business, politics, and other sectors. Epstein was convicted of sex offenses and died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

The document release has implications for the broader push for transparency embodied by the Epstein Transparency Act, which seeks to compel disclosure of government files related to Epstein's case.

Solomon's announcement did not specify an effective date for Ruemmler's resignation or name a successor.
