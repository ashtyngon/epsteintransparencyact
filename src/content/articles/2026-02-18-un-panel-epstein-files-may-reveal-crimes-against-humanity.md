A panel of United Nations experts said allegations detailed in documents released by the Justice Department from its investigation of Jeffrey Epstein could amount to crimes against humanity under international law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The group of experts, appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council, made the statement in response to the millions of documents the DOJ released connected to its probe of the convicted sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The release followed passage of the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which mandated disclosure of government records related to Epstein's case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## What Crimes Against Humanity Means

Crimes against humanity constitute one of the most serious categories of offenses under international law. The designation typically applies to systematic attacks directed against civilian populations, including acts such as enslavement, sexual violence, torture, and enforced disappearance.

Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, crimes against humanity are comparable in gravity to genocide and war crimes. The classification requires that acts be committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack.

## Document Release Context

The Justice Department [began releasing Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) after Congress passed the Epstein Transparency Act with bipartisan support. The documents stem from federal investigations into Epstein's criminal conduct spanning multiple decades.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors had accused him of operating a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls at his properties in Manhattan, Palm Beach, and other locations.

His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on five federal counts, including sex trafficking of minors. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

## International Response

The U.N. Human Rights Council appoints independent experts, known as Special Rapporteurs or members of working groups, to examine and report on specific human rights issues. These experts serve in their personal capacity and are not U.N. staff members.

[French prosecutors have launched two separate investigations](/news/2026-02-18-french-prosecutors-launch-two-epstein-probes-call-for-victim-complaints) into allegations involving Epstein and called for victims to file complaints. [European police agencies have opened new probes](/news/2026-02-18-epstein-files-revelations-spark-new-european-police-probes) based on information in the released documents.

Critics have [accused the Justice Department of failing to fully comply](/news/2026-02-18-doj-accused-of-flouting-epstein-transparency-act) with the Epstein Transparency Act's disclosure requirements. The law required release of all records related to federal investigations of Epstein within specified timeframes.

The DOJ has not publicly commented on the U.N. panel's characterization of the allegations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
