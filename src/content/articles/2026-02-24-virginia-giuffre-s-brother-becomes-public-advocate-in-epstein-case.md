**Virginia Giuffre's** younger brother has become a public advocate for survivors of sex trafficking following his sister's allegations against **Jeffrey Epstein** and **Ghislaine Maxwell**, according to **USA Today**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The report profiles the sibling relationship between Giuffre and her brother, though specific details about his current advocacy initiatives were not included in the available source material.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Giuffre has been one of the most prominent accusers in the Epstein case, publicly stating she was trafficked beginning when she was 17 years old.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Giuffre's advocacy gained international attention when she filed a civil lawsuit against **Prince Andrew**, Duke of York, alleging he sexually abused her when she was a minor.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The case was settled in February 2022, with Prince Andrew making a substantial donation to Giuffre's charity supporting victims' rights, though he admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> In February 2026, [Prince Andrew was arrested in London](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrest-linked-to-virginia-giuffre-s-advocacy) over allegations related to the Epstein case, a development that [brought renewed focus to the Giuffre family's advocacy efforts](/news/2026-02-19-giuffre-family-broken-hearts-lifted-by-andrew-s-arrest).

## Maxwell Conviction and Victims' Compensation

Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges including sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison in June 2022 for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The **Victims' Compensation Fund**, established after Epstein's death, processed claims from more than 150 women who alleged abuse by Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The fund distributed approximately $121 million to claimants before concluding its work.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died by apparent suicide in a Manhattan federal jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida as part of a controversial non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> That agreement, negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney **Alexander Acosta**, allowed Epstein to serve only 13 months in a county jail with work release privileges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Transparency and Survivor Advocacy

The **Epstein Transparency Act**, signed into law in early 2025, requires federal agencies to review and declassify documents related to Epstein within 180 days, with limited exceptions for national security and ongoing investigations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The legislation passed both chambers of Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Giuffre has been vocal about the lasting trauma experienced by Epstein's victims and has advocated publicly for other survivors to come forward.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Her case helped bring wider attention to the scope of Epstein's alleged trafficking network and the institutional failures that allowed his abuse to continue for years.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
