**Attorney General Pam Bondi** sent a six-page letter to Congress on February 15 claiming the Department of Justice has released "all" documents related to the Epstein Transparency Act. The letter included a list of names found in Epstein's contacts that featured deceased celebrities including **Marilyn Monroe** and **Janis Joplin** — both of whom died decades before Jeffrey Epstein began his financial career.

Lawmakers who authored the transparency legislation immediately disputed the assertion. **Rep. Thomas Massie**, who co-wrote the law requiring publication of Epstein-related files, told reporters Bondi "was afraid to look at Epstein survivors" during her recent congressional testimony, according to The Hill.

The document release, which Bondi characterized as complete, has drawn sharp criticism from members of Congress who say the inclusion of long-dead public figures obscures rather than illuminates the scope of Epstein's network.

## DOJ Letter Lists Dead Celebrities

Bondi's letter to members of Congress included names extracted from Epstein's contact records, according to The Independent. The list featured entertainment figures who died in the 1960s and 1970s — individuals who could not have had contact with Epstein during his lifetime.

Monroe died in 1962. Joplin died in 1970. Epstein began his career in finance in the 1970s and founded his own firm in 1982.

The BBC reported that lawmakers, "including those who wrote the law requiring their publication, argue the release is insufficient." The inclusion of deceased celebrities in a disclosure meant to identify Epstein's actual associates drew immediate pushback from transparency advocates.

## Congressional Authors Challenge Completeness Claim

Massie and other legislators who crafted the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) have publicly contested the DOJ's assertion that all required documents have been disclosed.

In a statement reported by The Independent, lawmakers accused Bondi of "purposefully muddying" the list of names associated with Epstein. The criticism centers on the DOJ's method of presenting information from contact lists without context about the nature or timing of relationships.

The [FBI's earlier explanation for redactions](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) cited ongoing investigations and privacy concerns for victims. Bondi's recent letter makes no mention of additional documents being withheld on these grounds, stating instead that disclosure obligations have been met in full.

Massie's observation about Bondi's demeanor during testimony before Congress references a hearing where [Epstein survivors attended](/news/2026-02-15-epstein-survivor-juliette-bryant-thought-i-was-going-to-die) and pressed officials on the pace and scope of document releases.

## International Resignations Continue

CBS News reported that "revelations from the latest release of Epstein files have forced resignations and sparked new investigations around the globe."

The pattern of international consequences stands in contrast to domestic outcomes. As previously reported, [European elites have faced career consequences while U.S. officials largely retain their positions](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-files-topple-european-elites-while-u-s-officials-keep-power).

Recent resignations include the [Dubai ports chief](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), who stepped down after hundreds of emails surfaced. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) also departed following disclosure of his name in released files. [Casey Wasserman sold his sports agency](/news/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-agency-after-epstein-files-expose-ties) after documents detailed his connections to Epstein and Maxwell.

[France established a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review files for French nationals, while [UK police launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations. [French prosecutors have begun investigating a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) identified in the files.

## Pattern of Disputed Disclosures

The current dispute over document completeness follows previous conflicts between the Justice Department and congressional oversight.

[Rep. Nancy Mace accused the DOJ](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) of hiding names in the release. [Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Trump's handling](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) of the Epstein files a "political miscalculation." [Massie has criticized the Trump DOJ](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) over the extent of redactions.

In testimony before Congress, [Bondi defended the DOJ's approach](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) to selective disclosure, citing investigative and privacy concerns. That position now sits alongside her assertion that all required documents have been released.

The DOJ has faced separate criticism over [allegations of monitoring Democrats' searches](/news/2026-02-13-ag-bondi-caught-spying-on-democrats-epstein-files-searches) of Epstein files and [accusations of a cover-up](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) related to redaction decisions.

## Next Steps

The dispute over document completeness appears headed for continued congressional action. Lawmakers who authored the transparency legislation maintain that substantial material remains undisclosed.

[Court releases of Epstein-related documents](/news/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents) continue separately from DOJ disclosures under the transparency act. The [FBI's review of records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the new law remains ongoing, despite Bondi's assertion of complete disclosure.

Congressional hearings on the scope of the release have not been publicly scheduled. Massie and other lawmakers have not specified what additional action they plan regarding Bondi's February 15 letter.

International investigations in France and the United Kingdom proceed independently of U.S. disclosure decisions. The substantive gap between Bondi's characterization of disclosure as complete and congressional authors' assessment of the release as insufficient has not been resolved.
