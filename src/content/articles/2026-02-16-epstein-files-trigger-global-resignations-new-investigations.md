**Attorney General Pam Bondi** sent a six-page letter to Congress on February 15 claiming the Department of Justice has released "all" documents related to the Epstein Transparency Act. The letter included a list of names found in Epstein's contacts that featured deceased celebrities including **Marilyn Monroe** and **Janis Joplin** — both of whom died decades before Jeffrey Epstein began his financial career.

Lawmakers who authored the transparency legislation immediately disputed the assertion. **Rep. Thomas Massie**, who co-wrote the law requiring publication of Epstein-related files, told reporters Bondi "was afraid to look at Epstein survivors" during her recent congressional testimony, according to The Hill.

The document release, which Bondi characterized as complete, has drawn sharp criticism from members of Congress who say the inclusion of long-dead public figures obscures rather than illuminates the scope of Epstein's network.

## DOJ Letter Lists Dead Celebrities

Bondi's letter to members of Congress included names extracted from Epstein's contact records, according to The Independent. The list featured entertainment figures who died in the 1960s and 1970s — individuals who could not have had contact with Epstein during his lifetime.

Monroe died in 1962. Joplin died in 1970. Epstein began his career in finance in the 1970s and founded his own firm in 1982.

The BBC reported that lawmakers, "including those who wrote the law requiring their publication, argue the release is insufficient." The inclusion of deceased celebrities in a disclosure meant to identify Epstein's actual associates drew immediate pushback from transparency advocates.

## Congressional Authors Challenge Completeness Claim

Massie and other legislators who crafted the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) have publicly contested the DOJ's assertion that all required documents have been disclosed.

In a statement reported by The Independent, lawmakers accused Bondi of "purposefully muddying" the list of names associated with Epstein. The criticism centers on the DOJ's method of presenting information from contact lists without context about the nature or timing of relationships.

The [FBI's earlier explanation for redactions](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) cited ongoing investigations and privacy concerns for victims. Bondi's recent letter makes no mention of additional documents being withheld on these grounds, stating instead that disclosure obligations have been met in full.

Massie's observation about Bondi's demeanor during testimony before Congress references a hearing where [Epstein survivors attended](/news/2026-02-15-epstein-survivor-juliette-bryant-thought-i-was-going-to-die) and pressed officials on the pace and scope of document releases.

## International Resignations Continue

CBS News reported that "revelations from the latest release of Epstein files have forced resignations and sparked new investigations around the globe."

The pattern of international consequences stands in contrast to domestic outcomes. As previously reported, European elites have faced career consequences while U.S. officials largely retain their positions.

Recent resignations include the Dubai ports chief, who stepped down after hundreds of emails surfaced. Goldman Sachs' top lawyer also departed following disclosure of his name in released files. Casey Wasserman sold his sports agency after documents detailed his connections to Epstein and Maxwell.

France established a special team to review files for French nationals, while UK police launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations. French prosecutors have begun investigating a diplomat identified in the files.

## Pattern of Disputed Disclosures

The current dispute over document completeness follows previous conflicts between the Justice Department and congressional oversight.

Rep. Nancy Mace accused the DOJ of hiding names in the release. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Trump's handling of the Epstein files a "political miscalculation." Massie has criticized the Trump DOJ over the extent of redactions.

In testimony before Congress, Bondi defended the DOJ's approach to selective disclosure, citing investigative and privacy concerns. That position now sits alongside her assertion that all required documents have been released.

The DOJ has faced separate criticism over allegations of monitoring Democrats' searches of Epstein files and accusations of a cover-up related to redaction decisions.

## Prominent Names Under Scrutiny

Congressional investigations continue into multiple high-profile figures. Congress subpoenaed Peter Mandelson and Les Wexner to testify about their Epstein connections.

Documents have detailed relationships involving Orioles owner David Rubenstein, media mogul Michael Ferro, Piers Morgan, and Prince Andrew.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's Epstein contacts have become a political issue for Republicans. Trump insider Tom Barrack appears in released files. Leon Black's name in the files prompted schools to cancel photo day events.

Files revealed Epstein's influence at academic institutions, with college presidents and professors named. NYC schools chief Joel Klein met with Epstein in 2013, three years after Epstein's conviction.

## Institutional Investigations Expand

A Bank of America lawsuit alleging the institution facilitated trafficking has been allowed to proceed. The New York Times launched a major investigation into millions of Epstein files.

Documents show Epstein used Nobel Prize access to build his network. Nobel committee chief Thorbjørn Jagland received gifts from Epstein, according to emails.

Political consultants pitched Epstein access to New York Democrats in exchange for donations. A senator blocked Epstein files after receiving a donation, according to prior reporting.

The FBI holds thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's island operation connected to the case.

## Public Pressure Intensifies

Podcaster Joe Rogan told listeners the Epstein files "scare the hell out of me." Files have spread virally across social media platforms.

Rep. Ro Khanna demanded names be disclosed after a major associate stepped down. One lawmaker named six men still hidden in files despite the transparency law.

Massie declared "I am not suicidal" as pressure mounted over his push for fuller disclosure. He has since lost confidence in Bondi over the files clash.

Trump has called for an end to the Epstein investigation, according to prior reporting.

## Maxwell Seeks Deal

Ghislaine Maxwell has offered to reveal the "truth" in exchange for clemency, according to recent reports. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.

Newly released video from Epstein's office appeared in the latest document dump. Prince Andrew's aide advised Epstein to hide his conviction on visa forms, according to released communications.

UK's top prosecutor stated "nobody is above the law" as police opened an investigation into Prince Andrew.

## Next Steps

The dispute over document completeness appears headed for continued congressional action. Lawmakers who authored the transparency legislation maintain that substantial material remains undisclosed.

Court releases of Epstein-related documents continue separately from DOJ disclosures under the transparency act. The FBI's review of records under the new law remains ongoing, despite Bondi's assertion of complete disclosure.

Congressional hearings on the scope of the release have not been publicly scheduled. Massie and other lawmakers have not specified what additional action they plan regarding Bondi's February 15 letter.

International investigations in France and the United Kingdom proceed independently of U.S. disclosure decisions. The substantive gap between Bondi's characterization of disclosure as complete and congressional authors' assessment of the release as insufficient has not been resolved.
