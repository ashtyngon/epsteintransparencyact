Police searches were expected to continue Saturday at Royal Lodge in Windsor, the former home of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as calls grow for a probe into his links with Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Guardian's police and crime correspondent, Vikram Dodd, discussed what could be next for Andrew in the investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Andrew was [arrested earlier this week](/news/2026-02-19-prince-andrew-arrested-in-london-over-epstein-documents) on document-sharing charges related to the Epstein case. Following his arrest, King Charles [stripped Andrew of his royal title](/news/2026-02-21-king-charles-distances-himself-from-prince-andrew-over-epstein-ties), reducing him to the name Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

Police have [widened their investigation](/news/2026-02-22-police-widen-prince-andrew-investigation-after-epstein-files-arrest) into Andrew's Epstein connections since the arrest. Scotland Yard [expanded the probe this week to question his protection officers](/news/2026-02-20-scotland-yard-expands-andrew-probe-questions-protection-officers-on-epstein-link) about potential links between Andrew and the convicted sex offender.

## Political Response

A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said the party would support a bill to remove Andrew from the line of succession if the government brings it forward with the support of King Charles.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"If the government bring forward this bill with the support of the King then we will back it," the spokesperson said.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> "We have to be realistic. Andrew is the eighth in line to the throne, so there's no chance of him becoming our monarch."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The spokesperson added that Parliament "should be focused on things that are of more importance to the public, whether that's the economy, crime, the health service, immigration," but confirmed the party would support the bill if it comes before Parliament.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The UK government has [been considering removing Andrew from the line of succession](/news/2026-02-21-u-k-considers-removing-andrew-from-royal-succession-after-arrest) following his arrest. British newspapers have also [called for a formal inquiry](/news/2026-02-22-u-k-papers-call-for-prince-andrew-epstein-inquiry) into Andrew's relationship with Epstein.
