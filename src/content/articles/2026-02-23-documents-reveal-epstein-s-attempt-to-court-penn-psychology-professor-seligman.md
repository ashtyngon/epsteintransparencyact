Newly released documents reveal Jeffrey Epstein's attempts to cultivate a relationship with Martin Seligman, a prominent psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The documents show how the convicted sex offender sought to court Seligman, who is widely recognized as the founder of positive psychology.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Seligman has held faculty positions at Penn for decades and serves as director of the university's Positive Psychology Center.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Seligman's Academic Profile

Seligman's research on learned helplessness, resilience, and well-being has influenced fields ranging from clinical psychology to education and military training. His work established positive psychology as a distinct discipline focused on human flourishing and optimal functioning rather than solely treating mental illness.

The newly disclosed materials add to growing evidence documenting Epstein's systematic approach to building relationships with scientists and academics across multiple universities, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Prior to his arrest, he had donated millions of dollars to various academic institutions and maintained ties with researchers at Harvard, MIT, and other prominent universities.

## Pattern of Academic Outreach

The documents obtained by The Daily Pennsylvanian provide insight into the methods Epstein used to approach Seligman.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The disclosure represents part of an ongoing release process that has revealed the extent of Epstein's network across elite academic, scientific, and social circles.

Epstein's connections to academic institutions have faced scrutiny since his 2019 arrest. Multiple universities, including Harvard and MIT, have conducted internal reviews of their financial relationships with Epstein and issued public statements distancing themselves from the financier.

The broader academic community has grappled with questions about due diligence in accepting funding from wealthy donors and the ethical implications of associating with individuals later revealed to have criminal backgrounds. Several universities have implemented stricter vetting procedures for major donors in the wake of the Epstein scandal.

Penn has not issued a public statement specifically addressing the newly disclosed documents about Seligman, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The disclosure adds to the public record of Epstein's cultivation of relationships with prominent academics across multiple disciplines, a pattern that has emerged from various document releases and investigative reports since his 2019 arrest.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
