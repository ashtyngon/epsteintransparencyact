Casey Wasserman announced Friday he will sell his Hollywood talent and marketing agency after communications with Ghislaine Maxwell surfaced in Justice Department documents released this month as part of the Epstein files.

Clients including pop star Chappell Roan and soccer player Abby Wambach cut ties with the firm after the emails became public. Wasserman, whose agency represents Coldplay, Ed Sheeran and Kendrick Lamar, told staff he had "become a distraction" due to "past personal mistakes."

## Third Major Resignation

Wasserman's exit follows two other high-profile departures tied to the Epstein document release. [Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem stepped down as chair of Dubai's DP World](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties) after hundreds of emails between him and Epstein's network surfaced. [Goldman Sachs lost its top lawyer](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the files.

The Justice Department released investigative materials on Epstein earlier this month under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which became law in January. The records include emails, flight logs, and financial documents spanning decades of Epstein's connections to business leaders, politicians, and celebrities.

## Son of Hollywood Legend

Wasserman, 51, is the son of Lew Wasserman, who built MCA into an entertainment empire. Beyond representing talent, he led Los Angeles's bid for the 2028 Olympics.

The agency has not disclosed how many clients left after the Maxwell communications surfaced, or what the emails contained. Wasserman did not announce a timeline for the sale.

[Congressional investigators have subpoenaed multiple people](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) named in the files to testify about their connections to Epstein's network.
