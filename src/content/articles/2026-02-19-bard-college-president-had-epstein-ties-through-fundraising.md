**Leon Botstein**, president of **Bard College** in New York, maintained contact with **Jeffrey Epstein** while leading fundraising efforts to save his institution from financial collapse, according to a New York Times report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The relationship has drawn scrutiny as more details emerge about Epstein's connections to academic and cultural figures.

Botstein communicated with Epstein about music, watches, and young female musicians during the period when he was working to secure millions in donations for Bard College, the Times reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The college had faced potential closure before Botstein's fundraising campaign stabilized its finances.

The New York Times characterized Botstein as being "seen as a campus savior" for his role in rescuing Bard College from financial crisis.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The report did not specify the total amount Botstein raised or whether Epstein personally donated to the institution.

## Epstein's Pattern of Academic Connections

Epstein maintained relationships with multiple figures in higher education and cultural institutions. Documents previously released showed his donations to various educational initiatives, including arts programs that gave him access to young people.<sup>[2](/news/2026-02-19-epstein-used-arts-camp-donations-to-access-teen-victims-npr-docs-show)</sup>

The Botstein revelations emerged as other prominent figures have faced questions about their Epstein associations. **Les Wexner**, the billionaire founder of L Brands, told Congress he was "duped" by Epstein in testimony last week.<sup>[3](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony)</sup>

**Bill Gates** withdrew from an artificial intelligence summit in India following renewed attention to his meetings with Epstein.<sup>[4](/news/2026-02-19-bill-gates-withdraws-from-india-ai-summit-over-epstein-ties)</sup>

## UK Government Faces Continued Scrutiny

The detention of **Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor**, formerly known as Prince Andrew, has maintained focus on connections between the UK government of Prime Minister **Sir Keir Starmer** and Epstein, according to the New York Times.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at the **Sandringham estate** on suspicion of misconduct in public office, according to The Guardian.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> **Thames Valley Police** previously stated they were reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Andrew, the Guardian reported.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Police are assessing whether Mountbatten-Windsor shared sensitive information with Epstein, according to the Guardian report.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The arrest followed earlier UK police announcements that they were evaluating [Epstein trafficking claims at Stansted Airport](/news/2026-02-18-uk-police-assess-epstein-trafficking-claims-at-stansted-airport).

The New York Times reported that the detention "maintains the spotlight on links" between Starmer's government and Epstein.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The report did not detail specific connections between current government officials and Epstein.

## Campbell Named in Documents

**Naomi Campbell** responded to her appearance in Epstein-related documents, where her name was mentioned over 300 times, according to The Tab.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The report did not include details of Campbell's statement or the context of the references in the documents.

Black Enterprise previously reported that Campbell stayed in Epstein's orbit but denies ties to his illegal activities.<sup>[5](/news/2026-02-18-supermodel-naomi-campbell-stayed-in-epstein-s-orbit-but-denies-ties-with-his-ill)</sup>

The volume of references to public figures in unsealed documents has prompted multiple institutions and individuals to issue statements. The records were released following passage of federal transparency legislation.

## Document Releases Continue

The FBI began reviewing Epstein-related records under the new transparency law passed by Congress.<sup>[6](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review)</sup> Courts have released multiple batches of previously sealed documents in recent months.

The disclosures have revealed patterns of how Epstein cultivated relationships with wealthy donors, academics, and cultural figures over decades. Files showed he used donations to arts and education programs to gain access to institutions and individuals.

A United Nations panel previously stated that Epstein files may reveal crimes against humanity.<sup>[7](/news/2026-02-18-un-panel-epstein-files-may-reveal-crimes-against-humanity)</sup> The panel's statement did not specify which documents or allegations led to that assessment.

## Institutional Responses

Educational institutions have faced questions about how they handled relationships with Epstein. The Central Dauphin School District in Pennsylvania responded to concerns about a contractor's connection to Epstein's network.<sup>[8](/news/2026-02-19-central-dauphin-school-district-responds-to-lifetouch-epstein-link)</sup>

Mondaq reported that the Epstein files highlight reputational and legal risks faced by organizations that accepted funding from problematic benefactors.<sup>[9](/news/2026-02-19-epstein-files-highlight-reputational-and-legal-risks-of-problematic-benefactors-)</sup>

The FBI's ongoing review under the transparency legislation may produce additional document releases in coming months. Congressional committees have held hearings with witnesses who had financial or personal relationships with Epstein.
