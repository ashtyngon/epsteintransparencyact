MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito resigned in 2019 after internal documents showed he helped Jeffrey Epstein donate $1.7 million to the lab while concealing the financier's identity from university officials. Ito also accepted $1.2 million from Epstein for his personal investment funds.

MIT President L. Rafael Reif later apologized for the institution's handling of Epstein donations, calling it "a collective and significant failure of judgment."

Harvard professor Martin Nowak received $6.5 million from Epstein in 2003 to establish the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. Flight logs and visitor records released under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) show Nowak visited Epstein's private island and Manhattan townhouse multiple times between 2012 and 2014 — four years after Epstein's conviction as a sex offender.

Harvard placed Nowak on administrative leave in 2020. 

## Presidents Met Convicted Sex Offender

Former Harvard president Lawrence Summers met with Epstein at least six times after his 2008 conviction. Summers, who served as Harvard's president from 2001 to 2006, described the meetings as focused on "serious scientific and economic topics" but later called them "a significant error in judgment."

Bard College president Leon Botstein invited Epstein to campus twice in 2013 and met with him in New York at least four times between 2012 and 2015. Botstein told the Times he was "completely unaware" of the nature of Epstein's crimes.

In a 2014 email to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein wrote that his university connections provided "social cover" and helped him "seem legitimate."

## Millions Bypassed Screening

Epstein donated at least $9.2 million to academic institutions and individual researchers between 2000 and 2019. Harvard received at least $9.1 million from Epstein between 1998 and 2007. The university returned $200,000 in unspent funds after his conviction.

The funds often bypassed normal vetting procedures that would have flagged his criminal record. At Harvard, gifts over $100,000 require senior administrative review. At MIT, the threshold is $50,000. Epstein's donations sometimes circumvented these processes by being structured as gifts to individual labs rather than the institution.

Stephen Kosslyn, a former Harvard psychology professor who became founding dean of Minerva Schools, flew on Epstein's private jet in 2005. Kosslyn told the Times the flight was arranged by a colleague and he had "minimal interaction" with Epstein.

Ruth Simmons, now president of Prairie View A&M University and former president of Brown University, served on Epstein's foundation board in 2000. Simmons resigned before Epstein's first arrest in 2006. She declined to comment.

MIT announced new donor screening procedures in 2020. Harvard created a committee to review donor relationships.
