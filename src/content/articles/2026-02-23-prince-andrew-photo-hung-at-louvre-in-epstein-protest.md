Activists displayed a large photograph of **Prince Andrew** inside the **Louvre Museum** in Paris to protest his alleged misconduct related to **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to **RFI**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The demonstration took place inside the museum, using one of the world's most prominent cultural venues to draw attention to the Duke of York's ties to the convicted sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The photograph was hung within the Louvre's galleries, where millions of international visitors pass through each year.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Background on Prince Andrew's Epstein Ties

Prince Andrew's association with Epstein has generated sustained controversy since the financier's 2008 conviction on state charges of procuring a minor for prostitution in Florida. The Duke of York continued meeting with Epstein after that conviction, including a 2010 visit to Epstein's New York mansion that was photographed and later became a focal point of public criticism.

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted in December 2021 on charges of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse. She is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.

Prince Andrew faced a civil lawsuit filed by **Virginia Giuffre**, who accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 at properties owned by Epstein and Maxwell in London, New York, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In February 2022, Andrew reached a settlement with Giuffre for undisclosed terms. The settlement included no admission of liability, though Andrew acknowledged in a statement that he "never intended to malign" Giuffre's character.

## European Investigations Intensify

The Louvre demonstration reflects mounting pressure on Prince Andrew in Europe. [A UK Member of Parliament recently sought a treason probe](/news/2026-02-22-uk-mp-seeks-treason-probe-into-prince-andrew-over-epstein) into the Duke's Epstein connections, while [France has launched a diplomat inquiry](/news/2026-02-23-france-launches-diplomat-inquiry-over-epstein-ties) examining ties between French officials and Epstein's network.

The choice of the Louvre as a protest venue appears calculated to maximize international visibility. The museum is France's most visited cultural institution and among the most recognizable landmarks in Paris. Staging a demonstration there guaranteed attention from both media outlets and the global public.

Public scrutiny of Epstein's network has accelerated following recent U.S. government document releases. The disclosures have named hundreds of individuals who had contact with Epstein, triggering investigations and resignations across multiple countries.

Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations of sexual misconduct. He withdrew from public royal duties in 2019 following a BBC interview about his Epstein connections that was widely criticized. In 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped him of his military titles and royal patronages.

The activist group responsible for the Louvre demonstration was not identified in the report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
