House Democrats have invited survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation to attend President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, NBC News reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The news outlet reported the planned attendance of survivors at the joint session of Congress. NBC News did not specify which Democratic members extended the invitations or identify the survivors who would attend.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Guest Tradition

Members of Congress routinely bring guests to the annual State of the Union address to spotlight specific policy issues or advocacy causes. Guests typically sit in the House gallery during the president's speech and are often recognized in media coverage of the event.

The practice has been used by lawmakers from both parties to amplify voices of individuals affected by specific policies or events. Past State of the Union guests have included activists, crime survivors, military families, and individuals impacted by policy decisions.

The guest invitation allows members to draw attention to issues they believe warrant national focus during one of the most widely covered political events of the year.

## Ongoing Epstein File Scrutiny

The survivor invitations come as members of Congress have pressed federal agencies over document releases related to Epstein's crimes and associates. The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in 2025, requires federal agencies to declassify and release records related to Epstein within specific timeframes.

The Justice Department began releasing documents under the Act in February 2025. Multiple lawmakers have [criticized the releases as incomplete](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions), citing heavy redactions and apparent omissions of key information.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in a Manhattan jail cell. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Multiple survivors have testified publicly about abuse they experienced as minors, with some appearing at Maxwell's 2021 trial. Others have participated in congressional hearings and advocacy efforts calling for full disclosure of documents related to Epstein's crimes and the individuals in his network.
