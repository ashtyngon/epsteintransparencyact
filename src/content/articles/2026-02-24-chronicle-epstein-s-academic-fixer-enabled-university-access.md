The Chronicle of Higher Education published an investigation into an individual who served as an "academic fixer" for Jeffrey Epstein, facilitating his access to universities and research institutions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The report, titled "Jeffrey Epstein's academic fixer," examines how the convicted sex offender cultivated relationships within higher education.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Chronicle's investigation identifies a person who enabled these academic connections, though full details of the report were not available at the time of publication.

## Epstein's University Connections

Epstein maintained extensive relationships with prestigious academic institutions despite lacking formal credentials. He donated millions to research centers and universities, gaining access to prominent scientists and academics.

His most significant institutional relationship was with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he donated at least $850,000 between 2002 and 2017, according to a 2020 investigation commissioned by MIT. The report, conducted by law firm Goodwin Procter, found that MIT accepted donations from Epstein despite concerns raised by some faculty and staff.

Epstein also maintained ties to Harvard University, where he visited campus frequently and had an office in the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. Harvard accepted $9.1 million from Epstein between 1998 and 2008, according to university records.

These academic connections continued after his 2008 Florida conviction on state charges of soliciting a minor. Despite his status as a registered sex offender, several institutions maintained relationships with Epstein until media coverage in 2019 prompted public scrutiny.

## University Reviews and Responses

Following Epstein's July 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking charges, multiple universities launched internal reviews. MIT President L. Rafael Reif commissioned the Goodwin Procter investigation, which released findings in January 2020.

Harvard University conducted its own internal review, concluding in May 2020 that the university should not have accepted Epstein's donations given his 2008 conviction. Then-Harvard President Lawrence Bacow acknowledged the university's failures in judgment.

The Chronicle's reporting on Epstein's "academic fixer" adds to ongoing scrutiny of how academic institutions facilitated the convicted offender's access to prestigious research communities.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Other universities, including Columbia University, have faced questions about staff who facilitated Epstein-linked admissions. [Columbia removed staff who facilitated an Epstein-linked dental school admission](/news/2026-02-16-columbia-removes-staff-who-facilitated-epstein-linked-dental-admission) earlier this month.

The DOJ released files in February 2026 showing [Epstein pulled strings at the University of Alabama](/news/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama), demonstrating the breadth of his academic influence.

Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
