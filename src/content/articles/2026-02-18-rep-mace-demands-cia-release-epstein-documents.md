**Rep. Nancy Mace** called on the Central Intelligence Agency to turn over all documents related to **Jeffrey Epstein** and **Ghislaine Maxwell**, according to a statement released Wednesday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The South Carolina Republican's demand came on the same day **Les Wexner**, the billionaire founder of Victoria's Secret's parent company, testified before the House Oversight Committee about his decades-long relationship with Epstein.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Mace's call for CIA documents represents an expansion of congressional scrutiny beyond the FBI and Justice Department files already under review. The request did not specify what types of CIA records Mace is seeking or whether the agency had previously acknowledged possessing Epstein-related materials.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The congresswoman has been a prominent voice pushing for full disclosure of government records related to Epstein's activities and associates. Her latest demand follows weeks of public pressure on multiple federal agencies to release classified or restricted files under the **Epstein Transparency Act**, which became law in January.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Wexner Testifies Before House Panel

Wexner appeared for a deposition Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee as part of the panel's ongoing investigation into Epstein's crimes.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The 87-year-old billionaire was among several Epstein associates subpoenaed by the committee.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

In a statement released to Democratic members of the committee before his testimony, Wexner described himself as "an ethical man, philanthropist and community builder who was 'duped by a world-class con man.'"<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> He told Congress, "I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide."<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Wexner characterized Epstein as "a world-class con man" during his deposition, according to Courthouse News.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The billionaire has spent years answering questions about his decadeslong association with Epstein, who served as his financial adviser and money manager from the 1980s until 2007.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Wexner has previously denied any misconduct related to Epstein.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> House Democrats scheduled a press conference to follow Wexner's closed-door deposition Wednesday afternoon.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## Epstein Ranch to Become Christian Retreat

Former **Texas state Sen. Don Huffines**, who purchased Epstein's **Zorro Ranch** in New Mexico, announced plans this week to convert the property into a Christian retreat.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Huffines, a Republican now running for Texas comptroller, made the announcement Tuesday during an appearance on former Rep. **Matt Gaetz's** One America News Network show.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The ranch property, located in New Mexico, was previously owned by Epstein and has been the subject of law enforcement scrutiny. Huffines and his family bought the ranch for **$13.4 million**, according to previous reports.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The planned conversion to a Christian retreat represents a significant change for a property that investigators have examined in connection with Epstein's criminal activities. Huffines did not provide additional details about the timeline or specific plans for the retreat center.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Broader Context of Ongoing Investigations

The congressional subpoenas and testimony represent the latest phase of government scrutiny into Epstein's network of associates and enablers. The House Oversight Committee has been conducting its investigation alongside separate reviews by federal law enforcement agencies.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Wexner's relationship with Epstein has drawn particular attention because of its duration and the financial power Epstein wielded over the billionaire's affairs. Epstein held power of attorney over Wexner's finances at the height of their relationship and managed significant portions of his wealth.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The committee's decision to subpoena multiple Epstein associates signals an intent to examine the broader network that enabled his criminal activities over decades. Wexner is among the most prominent figures to be called for testimony under subpoena power.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Mace's separate call for CIA records could open a new front in the disclosure battle, depending on whether the agency confirms it holds relevant documents. Previous releases under the Transparency Act have focused primarily on FBI and Justice Department files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
