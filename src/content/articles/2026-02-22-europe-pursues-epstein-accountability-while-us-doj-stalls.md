In the United Kingdom, police expanded their investigation into Prince Andrew's associations with Epstein. Officers conducted searches at Royal Lodge and questioned protection officers about Andrew's ties to Epstein, according to prior reporting documented on this site. A U.K. minister declined to rule out a judge-led inquiry into the matter.

France launched investigations into diplomatic connections documented in released Epstein files. French prosecutors opened probes and called for victim complaints following revelations in the document release.

## U.S. Response Criticized as Incomplete

The Washington Post reports the United States has been less forthcoming with accountability measures following the same revelations that prompted European action, describing the U.S. response as holding back.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The U.S. Justice Department released Epstein files under the Epstein Transparency Act, federal legislation requiring disclosure of government documents related to Epstein. However, members of Congress criticized the release as incomplete.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) accused the DOJ of hiding names in the files release. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) stated he lost confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi over redactions in the released documents, according to prior reporting on this site.

The FBI began its review of Epstein-related records following passage of the Transparency Act, which was signed into law and mandates release of certain federal records concerning Epstein's activities and associations.

## Background

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner. Epstein had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida involving solicitation of prostitution from a minor, serving 13 months in county jail under a controversial plea agreement.

His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested in July 2020 and convicted in December 2021 on federal charges including sex trafficking of minors. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The Washington Post report documents the ongoing international attention to Epstein-related matters and varying approaches to transparency and accountability across different jurisdictions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
