This week's document releases named a former Norwegian prime minister who led the Nobel Committee, a Dubai port executive mentioned more than 4,700 times, and a Commerce Secretary whose accounts of his Epstein connections have varied over time. The Justice Department has declared its Epstein file releases complete, while Attorney General Pam Bondi faces criticism from members of both parties.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The released documents show a series of connections between Epstein and individuals across continents and institutions.

## The Norwegian Connection: Nobel Committee Chairman

**The New York Times** [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/world/europe/norway-jagland-epstein.html) that **Thorbjorn Jagland**, a former prime minister of Norway who led the Nobel Committee, maintained what the Times described as "mutually beneficial ties" with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Newly released emails show Jagland "promised influence" while Epstein "had gifts to give," according to the Times.

Jagland served as chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 2009 to 2015. The specific nature of what Jagland offered and what Epstein provided has not been detailed in available reporting.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The existence of this contact during Jagland's tenure has prompted questions about Nobel Committee processes during that period.

Journalist **Anand Giridharadas** wrote in [a New York Times Opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-anand-giridharadas.html) published Friday that the files show what he called "the infrastructure of Jeffrey Epstein's power."<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## The Dubai Executive: 4,700 Mentions

**Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem**, CEO and chairman of **DP World**, Dubai's largest port operator, appears in the Epstein files more than **4,700 times**, according to CBS News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> That volume of mentions is higher than other individuals named in the files.

Bin Sulayem was [replaced this week](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) following the file releases.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> DP World, which operates ports across six continents and employs approximately 103,000 people, cited "strategic realignment" in a brief statement. The company did not provide further explanation.

[Lord Peter Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe), whom Congress has formally requested to testify, appears in the files with lower frequency.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Bin Sulayem's correspondence with Epstein remains almost entirely redacted in publicly available documents.

The Justice Department has not commented on the nature of the 4,700 documented interactions. Neither has DP World.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

DP World operates ports in London, Dubai, Australia, and across Asia.

## Bondi Faces Criticism From Both Parties

Attorney General **Pam Bondi** faced criticism from within her own political coalition this week over the pace and scope of document releases. According to **Axios**, "a chorus of top MAGA voices are calling for Attorney General Pam Bondi's removal" following her congressional testimony Wednesday.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

During the [roughly five-hour hearing](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release), Bondi faced "accusatory questions and heated exchanges" over the files, according to Axios.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> She did not acknowledge Epstein survivors present in the hearing room when asked to do so. All survivors in attendance stated they had not been given the opportunity to provide testimony to the DOJ under Bondi's leadership.

The Justice Department announced this week it has concluded its release of Epstein-related documents. As Axios reported, "Americans' thirst for answers and additional prosecutions persists, cracking the conservative coalition and causing a headache for President Trump."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Rep. **Ted Lieu** (D-Calif.) accused Bondi of lying under oath regarding Trump and Epstein's former relationship during the hearing. Bondi rejected the accusation.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Lutnick and Air Force One

**Howard Lutnick**, Trump's Commerce Secretary, received what **The Independent** described as "a coveted seat on Air Force One" this week for a presidential visit to Fort Bragg.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Independent noted that the invitation came despite Lutnick having given "conflicting accounts of his Epstein ties."

Lutnick's public explanations of his contact with Epstein have changed over time as additional documentation has emerged, according to reporting by The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The precise nature and extent of his connections remain unclear given continued redactions.

## Congressional Requests for Mandelson Testimony

**Rep. Robert Garcia**, ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and **Rep. Suhas Subramanyam** formally requested **Lord Peter Mandelson** testify to Congress regarding his documented contact with Epstein.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Their letter states Mandelson "holds critical information," according to congressional records.

Congress has subpoenaed Mandelson, though whether a British peer will comply with an American congressional subpoena remains uncertain. Mandelson served as British Business Secretary and European Commissioner for Trade before becoming the UK's ambassador to the United States.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

## Redactions and Disclosure

The FBI has stated that files remain "heavily redacted" to protect ongoing investigations and individual privacy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Lawmakers have noted that the DOJ has simultaneously cited ongoing investigations as justification for redactions while announcing the end of document releases.

Lawmakers have also noted that privacy-based redactions have shielded some prominent figures while victims' identities have appeared in the documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Bin Sulayem's name appears 4,700 times in documents the Justice Department possesses, but his name did not become public until recent releases.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

During her testimony, Bondi offered no timeline for when remaining redactions might be lifted and no criteria for continued withholding, according to hearing transcripts.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

One congressman read six names into the Congressional Record — names still redacted in official releases.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Institutional Departures

Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down after emails emerged in which she referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey."<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> DP World's chairman departed.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Multiple academic leaders have faced scrutiny.

A Bank of America lawsuit, allowed to proceed by a federal court, alleges the bank facilitated Epstein's activities through its banking services. The case is ongoing.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Current Status

The DOJ states its document release is complete. Congressional investigations continue. Civil lawsuits remain pending. The New York Times has assigned 24 journalists to review the files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

**President Trump** this week called for ending the Epstein investigation, according to CBS News.<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act mandated disclosure. Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the DOJ's redaction practices.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The files released so far document meetings and correspondence. Substantial portions remain redacted, and the content of many documented interactions has not been made public.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Survivors have attended hearings without being invited to testify. Documents remain withheld by the executive branch. Several named individuals have left their positions without public explanation.
