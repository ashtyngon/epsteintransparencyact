A **New York Times** investigation into the Epstein files concluded that, according to the documents, Jeffrey Epstein was "a sexual predator given a free ride by the ruling class."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

That assessment, published in the Times' examination titled "The Epstein Files and the Hidden World of an Unaccountable Elite," focuses on what the documents show about institutional dynamics at high levels of American power, according to the Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Document Review

Investigators continue reviewing the files for what the Times describes as "ironclad criminal conduct." That review is ongoing.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The documents, according to the Times, show Epstein maintaining contact with individuals and institutions over a period of decades.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## High-Profile Departures

The Times investigation was published as the Epstein files were followed by [a series of departures](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) — [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files), former White House counsel to President Obama, and [DP World chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), who appeared more than 4,700 times in the files, both left their positions after their names appeared in the documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Attorney General Pam Bondi faces pressure over why the Justice Department continues redacting documents. Congress has subpoenaed Les Wexner, described in the files as Epstein's longtime financier. One congressman read names into the Congressional Record that remained redacted in official releases.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Times' Framing

The phrase "ruling class" is the Times' own language, used in its investigation to describe what it says the documents show.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The investigation will take months to complete. The Times has assigned **24 journalists** to review the files, which would stack as high as the Empire State Building if printed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Document releases and departures continue. The Times investigation is focused on examining who knew about Epstein's conduct and what institutional responses occurred, according to the newspaper. The full scope of the network documented in the files remains only partially public.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
