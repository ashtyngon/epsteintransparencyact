MLive.com, a Michigan-based news organization, published a letter from its editor Thursday arguing that public outrage alone will not resolve the questions surrounding **Jeffrey Epstein**'s network, and that only sustained disclosure and institutional accountability can produce meaningful results.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The editorial, published Feb. 19, 2026, arrives at a moment when the Epstein case has produced a wave of resignations, international investigations and congressional hearings — but no new criminal prosecutions in the United States. The letter frames this gap between public anger and legal consequences as the central challenge facing the American response to the files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Disclosure Gap

The editorial's core argument — that outrage without accountability amounts to a dead end — reflects a tension that has defined the weeks since the Department of Justice released more than 3 million pages of Epstein-related documents on January 30, 2026, under the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law/).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Despite the volume of material released, critics have argued the disclosures remain incomplete. A study reported that the DOJ may have released [only a fraction of total Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows/), and the [FBI has explained its continued use of heavy redactions](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted/) by citing privacy concerns and ongoing investigations. UN human rights experts issued a statement in February 2026 calling the disclosures "flawed" and warning they "undermine accountability for grave crimes against women and girls."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Deputy Attorney General **Todd Blanche** drew bipartisan criticism when he appeared to dismiss calls for further prosecutions, saying, "It is not a crime to party with Mr. Epstein."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Attorney General **Pam Bondi** has separately [faced pressure from lawmakers](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release/) over the scope of the release.

## Accountability Without Prosecution

While no new criminal charges have been filed in the United States, the files have produced consequences abroad and in the private sector. Several high-profile figures have resigned, including [Goldman Sachs top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files/) and [DP World chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed/). Congress has issued subpoenas to [Lord Peter Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe/) and others. International law enforcement agencies have opened new investigations across Europe.

A December 2025 Economist/YouGov poll found that 55 percent of Americans disapproved of the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein investigation, while large majorities across party lines — 91 percent of Democrats, 78 percent of independents and 74 percent of Republicans — supported releasing the files.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Background

**Jeffrey Epstein** died on Aug. 10, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted on Dec. 29, 2021, of sex trafficking minors and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. No additional co-conspirators have been criminally charged.

The MLive editorial adds to a growing body of media commentary contending that public access to the files, while necessary, is insufficient without prosecutorial follow-through.
