MLive.com published a letter from its editor Thursday addressing the ongoing public response to revelations about Jeffrey Epstein's network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The letter, titled "Letter from the Editor: Outrage won't rescue us from the Epstein abyss. Disclosure and accountability must," argues that public outrage alone will not resolve questions surrounding the case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The headline suggests the editorial emphasizes the need for disclosure and accountability as necessary responses to the Epstein scandal, rather than relying solely on public anger or reactive statements.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The letter was published amid ongoing document releases, congressional testimony from individuals connected to Epstein, and international investigations into his network. MLive.com is a Michigan-based news organization.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The publication of the editorial letter comes as multiple institutions and individuals named in Epstein-related documents face renewed scrutiny over their past associations with the convicted sex offender.

Courts have released several batches of documents in recent months related to civil litigation involving Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021. The Epstein Transparency Act, which became law in late 2025, mandates federal agencies review and release records related to Epstein's case.

Epstein died by suicide in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Questions about the extent of his network and whether others participated in or enabled his crimes remain subjects of investigation and public debate.
