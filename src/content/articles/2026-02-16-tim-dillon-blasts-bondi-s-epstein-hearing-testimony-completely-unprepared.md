Podcaster Tim Dillon criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi as "unprepared" after she raised her voice about stock market performance during congressional testimony on the Justice Department's handling of Epstein files, according to The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"They're all unprepared," Dillon said of Trump administration officials who have testified about the case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His comments followed a hearing last week in which Bondi discussed economic indicators when questioned about [redacted Epstein document releases](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The criticism from Dillon, whose podcast attracts a conservative audience, adds to pressure on Bondi from multiple directions over her handling of the Epstein files.

## Conservative Criticism Over File Releases

Dillon's comments follow similar pushback from within Republican circles. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene [called Trump's handling of the Epstein files a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) last week.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, has become one of Bondi's sharpest critics. He [stated he "lost confidence" in Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) after exchanges during the hearing and stated Bondi avoided making eye contact with Epstein survivors present in the room.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Dispute Over Document Release

The central dispute concerns what the Justice Department has made public. Bondi publicly stated the DOJ released "all" files with "full names listed," but lawmakers from both parties have disputed this assertion.

An independent analysis found the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files when measured against the total volume of documents in federal custody.

Members of Congress accused Bondi of padding the list by including deceased celebrities alongside names of individuals with documented contact with Epstein. Rep. Nancy Mace separately accused the DOJ of withholding names in the February release.

Bondi released a list of 300 names earlier this month, but many files contain redactions that remove details about Epstein's network and activities.

## Political Fallout

The criticism crosses typical partisan divisions. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's documented contacts with Epstein have become a point of concern for GOP senators.

Multiple executives have resigned after being named in released documents, including Goldman Sachs' top lawyer and the Dubai ports chief.

The response has extended internationally. The UK launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations involving British nationals named in the files. France set up a special review team to examine references to French citizens.

Dillon's criticism represents a departure from typical conservative media responses to Trump administration controversies on the Epstein files issue.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
