**Rep. Nancy Mace** formally requested unredacted files on potential co-conspirators in the Jeffrey Epstein case, WCIV reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The South Carolina congresswoman's request comes as investigations expand in Paris, documents show political operatives maintaining contact with Epstein, and universities take action over their documented associations with the financier.

Mace's call for transparency follows weeks of dispute over the Department of Justice's release, which critics say represents only a fraction of existing Epstein files. The congresswoman joins other lawmakers, including [Rep. Thomas Massie](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) and [Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation), who have criticized the administration's handling of the document release.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Columbia University Disciplines Two Officials

**Columbia University** disciplined two administrators who facilitated entry of a woman connected to Jeffrey Epstein into its dental college, according to a New York Times investigation published February 16. The university took action against officials involved in the admission.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The university's response follows earlier reporting on [college presidents and professors named in Epstein files](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout).<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Epstein's documented contacts at academic institutions extended beyond Columbia. Documents showed Epstein sought to influence admissions at the University of Alabama, while other files showed his contacts with Nobel Prize officials.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Steve Bannon's Contact With Epstein

**Steve Bannon**, the podcaster and former White House chief strategist, maintained what the New York Times described as "a seemingly chummy relationship" with Epstein, according to text messages in newly released documents. The Times reported February 16 that Bannon continued contact with Epstein after the financier's conviction.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Bannon told the Times his communications with Epstein were "in the name of getting Mr. Epstein to open up." The texts indicate contact continued after Epstein's 2008 plea deal in Florida on charges of soliciting a minor.

Earlier reporting showed Bannon discussed Pope Francis with Epstein, according to DOJ files. The documents show the two discussed political strategy and contacts.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Bannon's documented contacts with Epstein add to a list of political figures whose communications with Epstein have appeared in recent weeks, including Trump insider Tom Barrack and members of Congress who sent Epstein invitations to congressional events years after his arrest.

## Texas Republican's Family Purchased Epstein Ranch

The family of **Donald Huffines**, a Republican running for Texas comptroller, purchased Jeffrey Epstein's New Mexico ranch for **$13.4 million** in 2023, according to The Guardian and the Santa Fe New Mexican. A spokesperson for Huffines, a former GOP state senator, confirmed the purchase.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The **Zorro Ranch** in New Mexico was identified in court documents as a location where Epstein allegedly abused underage girls and young women, according to The Guardian. The property sale occurred years after Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 conviction on sex trafficking charges.

Texas Republicans expressed concern about the purchase, according to The Guardian.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Huffines is running in a competitive race for Texas comptroller, one of the state's most powerful positions overseeing billions in tax revenue and economic forecasts.

## French Investigation Expands With Paris Raid

French authorities raided the **Arab World Institute** in Paris in connection with an expanding Epstein investigation, according to multiple outlets. The February 16 police action represents the latest development in France's review of Epstein files for French nationals.

French prosecutors previously announced they were investigating a diplomat in connection with the Epstein case. France established a special team dedicated to reviewing the document release for potential crimes involving French citizens.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

The raid occurred at the Arab World Institute, a Paris cultural center and museum. The specific connection between the institute and the Epstein investigation was not detailed in initial reports.

## UK Transparency Group Examines Mandelson Emails

**Transparency International UK** published an analysis examining what the **Peter Mandelson-Epstein emails** show about Britain's lobbying regulations, according to a February 16 report. The anti-corruption organization's review comes after Congress subpoenaed Mandelson over his contacts with Epstein.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>

Mandelson, a former European Union trade commissioner and Labour Party figure, appeared in emails with Epstein that discussed access to political figures, according to the released documents. The UK has launched multiple investigations into Epstein-related matters, including a national task force examining trafficking allegations and renewed scrutiny of Prince Andrew.

The group's analysis focused on systemic gaps in Britain's lobbying disclosure requirements that allowed relationships like those documented between Mandelson and Epstein to remain outside public view.

## FBI Holds Files on Detroit Millionaire's Island

The FBI possesses thousands of files related to **Frank Shelden**, a Detroit millionaire who operated on a remote, private island in Lake Michigan decades before Epstein's crimes became public, The Independent reported. Shelden's **North Fox Island** operation predated Epstein's network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Independent's reporting, based on interviews with a podcaster examining the cold case, said authorities did not fully investigate Shelden's activities despite possessing extensive documentation. The bureau has faced criticism over its handling of Epstein-related investigations, with the FBI citing ongoing investigations as justification for redactions in released documents.

## Institutional Accountability

Documents from Columbia University, French authorities, British anti-corruption watchdogs, and decades-old FBI files show what multiple investigations have described as institutional failures in oversight. A New York Times investigation found that failures at multiple levels of law enforcement and oversight allowed Epstein to maintain access to elite institutions.

Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned after being named in files. Dubai's ports chief resigned after hundreds of emails were made public. The files have prompted resignations and new investigations spanning Europe, Asia, and the Americas.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

A federal court allowed a lawsuit against Bank of America to proceed, alleging the bank facilitated Epstein's operations through financial services.

## Congressional Pressure Intensifies

Rep. Mace's request for unredacted files adds to congressional pressure on the Department of Justice.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> **Attorney General Pam Bondi** has defended the administration's release, stating the DOJ released "all" Epstein files, but an independent analysis found the government released only 2% of Epstein files.

Congress has issued subpoenas to multiple figures, including Les Wexner, the billionaire whose financial relationship with Epstein spanned decades. **Rep. Ro Khanna** stated that Epstein's network "knew enough to know better."

The Justice Department faces criticism from both parties. Rep. Massie stated he lost confidence in AG Bondi over the handling of file releases, while Rep. Greene called Trump's handling of the Epstein files a "political miscalculation."<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Technology Aids Public Review

Independent efforts to organize the released documents have emerged. A platform called **JeffTube** provides a searchable interface for DOJ Epstein files. Epstein emails have also circulated widely on social media.

Multiple congressional hearings have been scheduled in coming weeks. The Justice Department has not announced a timeline for any potential criminal charges arising from information in the released documents.
