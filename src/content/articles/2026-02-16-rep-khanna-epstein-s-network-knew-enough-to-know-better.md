Congress has subpoenaed billionaire Leslie Wexner and Peter Mandelson to testify about their contacts with Epstein.

## DOJ Position on Full Release

Attorney General Pam Bondi has stated the DOJ released all files, while citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns as reasons for continued redactions.
