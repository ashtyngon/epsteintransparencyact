Rep. Ro Khanna said members of Jeffrey Epstein's network "knew enough to know better" in a New York Times opinion piece published Saturday.

"Epstein's network may not have known everything, but it is hard to deny that many of them knew enough to know better," the California Democrat wrote.

Khanna's statement addresses elite figures who maintained relationships with Epstein after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

## Congressional Pressure Mounts

The remarks add to pressure from lawmakers across party lines demanding fuller disclosure of Epstein's contacts and activities.
