Representative Ro Khanna is calling for full disclosure of names in the Epstein files after Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the [DP World CEO who stepped down over Epstein emails](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), resigned from his position.

Khanna publicly praised the resignation and issued a clear demand: "name names."

## Second Major Resignation

Bin Sulayem's departure follows [Goldman Sachs top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler's resignation](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) earlier this week after emails showed she referred to Epstein as "uncle Jeffrey." Both held powerful positions—Bin Sulayem ran **DP World**, which operates ports across six continents and employs approximately 103,000 people, while Ruemmler served as co-chair of Goldman's reputational risk committee and was formerly White House counsel to President Obama.

In both cases, executives named in the Epstein document releases faced immediate pressure to step down. Corporate boards acted before any formal investigations concluded.

## Pressure on DOJ

Khanna's call for naming names puts additional pressure on the Justice Department, which continues to redact portions of Epstein-related files. [Attorney General Bondi faced aggressive questioning](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) from House lawmakers over the scope and pace of releases.

The congressman joins other House members who have criticized the pace of DOJ document releases. [One congressman used the House floor](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) to publicly identify individuals he says are being shielded by redactions.

## Institutions Under Scrutiny

The resignations extend beyond finance. [University presidents and professors](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) have faced mounting scrutiny, and [Congress has subpoenaed Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), Epstein's long-time patron and business partner.

Khanna's demand for transparency reflects growing impatience among lawmakers with incremental document releases and privacy protections that shield powerful figures. Two high-profile resignations occurred within one week of document releases naming the individuals involved.
