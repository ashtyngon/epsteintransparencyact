**Rep. Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) called for full disclosure of all names in the Epstein files on Feb. 13 after **Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem**, the chairman and CEO of global logistics firm DP World, [resigned his position following the release of hundreds of Epstein-related emails](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), according to Spectrum News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Khanna, who co-authored the Epstein Transparency Act with **Rep. Thomas Massie** (R-Ky.), said he and Massie "called on DOJ to stop protecting this man" and demanded the government "name names."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Khanna added: "Today, he resigns. We will not rest until there is elite accountability."<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Six Names Read on the House Floor

The resignation followed a dramatic sequence on Capitol Hill. On Feb. 10, Khanna took to the House floor and [read the names of six men whose identities had been redacted](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) in the publicly released files, using the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution to bypass DOJ secrecy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The names Khanna disclosed included bin Sulayem, **Leslie Wexner**, and four other individuals whose identities had been blacked out in the DOJ releases.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Massie confirmed that bin Sulayem was the recipient of an Epstein email containing the line "I loved the torture video," a reference that had circulated in redacted form for weeks.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Bin Sulayem's name appeared more than 4,700 times across the released documents, according to Newsweek.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## DP World Fallout

DP World, which operates ports across six continents and employs approximately 103,000 people, announced bin Sulayem's departure effective immediately on Feb. 13.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> The Dubai-based company named **Essa Kazim** as chairman and **Yuvraj Narayan** as CEO without referencing the Epstein connection in its statement.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

The resignation came after British International Investment, the United Kingdom's development finance agency, and La Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, Canada's second-largest pension fund, paused future ventures with DP World in response to the revelations.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Documents also showed Epstein acted as an intermediary to help bin Sulayem lobby the British government on DP World's 1.8 billion pound London Gateway port project in 2009.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

## Second Corporate Departure in One Week

Bin Sulayem's exit followed the resignation of [Goldman Sachs top lawyer **Kathryn Ruemmler**](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) earlier that week after emails surfaced in which she referred to Epstein as "uncle Jeffrey."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Ruemmler served as co-chair of Goldman's reputational risk committee and previously served as White House counsel to **President Barack Obama**.

In both cases, the executives left their positions within days of being identified in Epstein document releases.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Pressure on DOJ

Khanna's demands intensified pressure on the Justice Department, which has released approximately 3.5 million pages of files under the Epstein Transparency Act [signed into law Nov. 19, 2025](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law).<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Rep. **Jamie Raskin** (D-Md.) said roughly 3 million additional documents remained withheld.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

[Attorney General **Pam Bondi** faced questioning](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) from House lawmakers over the scope of redactions.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Massie accused Bondi of a cover-up after she told him nothing remained to release beyond child exploitation material, contradicting the redacted names he and Khanna had identified.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Congress has separately [subpoenaed Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), described in the files as Epstein's longtime financial patron, to testify under oath about their relationship.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
