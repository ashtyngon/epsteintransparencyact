## Second Corporate Departure

Bin Sulayem's departure followed [Goldman Sachs top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler's resignation](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) earlier that week after emails surfaced in which she referred to Epstein as "uncle Jeffrey."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Bin Sulayem ran **DP World**, which operates ports across six continents and employs approximately 103,000 people. Ruemmler served as co-chair of Goldman's reputational risk committee and was formerly White House counsel to President Obama.

In both cases, the executives left their positions after being named in Epstein document releases.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Pressure on DOJ

Khanna's call puts additional pressure on the Justice Department, which continues to redact portions of Epstein-related files.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> [Attorney General Bondi faced questioning](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) from House lawmakers over the scope and pace of releases.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Institutions Under Scrutiny

The departures extend beyond finance, according to Spectrum News. University presidents and professors have also faced scrutiny, and Congress has subpoenaed Les Wexner, described in the documents as Epstein's long-time financial patron.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Two high-profile departures occurred within one week of document releases naming the individuals involved.
