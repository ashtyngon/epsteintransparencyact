Representative Ro Khanna is calling for full disclosure of names in the Epstein files after Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the [DP World CEO who stepped down over Epstein emails](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-ceo-sultan-ahmed-bin-sulayem-forced-out-over-epstein-emails), resigned from his position.

Khanna publicly praised the resignation and issued a clear demand: "name names."

## Second Major Resignation

Bin Sulayem's departure follows [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resignation](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) earlier this week after damaging emails surfaced. Both men held powerful positions at major financial institutions—Bin Sulayem ran the Dubai-based port operator, while Goldman's general counsel served as one of Wall Street's most influential attorneys.

The pattern is becoming clear: executives named in the Epstein document releases are facing immediate pressure to step down. Corporate boards are no longer waiting for investigations to conclude before acting.

## Pressure on DOJ

Khanna's call for naming names puts additional pressure on the Justice Department, which continues to redact portions of Epstein-related files. [Attorney General Bondi faced aggressive questioning](/articles/2026-02-13-house-judiciary-grills-ag-over-growing-epstein-connections) from House lawmakers over the scope and pace of releases.

The congressman joins other House members who have grown frustrated with DOJ stonewalling. [One congressman used the House floor](/articles/2026-02-13-congressman-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-on-house-floor) to publicly identify individuals he says are being shielded by redactions.

## Institutions Under Scrutiny

The resignations extend beyond finance. [University presidents and professors](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) have faced mounting scrutiny, and [Congress has subpoenaed Les Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties), Epstein's long-time patron and business partner.

Khanna's demand for transparency reflects growing impatience with incremental document releases and privacy protections that shield powerful figures. With two high-profile resignations in one week, the question facing other executives named in the files is straightforward: step down now, or wait for the pressure to become unbearable.
