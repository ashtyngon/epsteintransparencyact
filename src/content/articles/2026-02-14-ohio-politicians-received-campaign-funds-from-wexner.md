Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Leslie Wexner, according to WFMJ, which identified the billionaire as an alleged Epstein co-conspirator.

WFMJ reviewed state campaign finance records but did not specify which politicians received contributions, the amounts, or the time periods involved.

Wexner, the founder of L Brands, was [subpoenaed by Congress last week](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about his financial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

The report comes as multiple states examine political contributions from individuals named in recently released Epstein-related documents. [A senator in another state faced scrutiny](/articles/2026-02-13-senator-blocked-epstein-files-after-receiving-mysterious-donation) after receiving a donation and subsequently blocking transparency legislation.

WFMJ did not report whether any Ohio politicians plan to return the contributions or comment on their acceptance of funds from Wexner.
