Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Leslie Wexner, Epstein's only confirmed financial client and the Columbus-based billionaire who founded L Brands (parent company of Victoria's Secret), according to WFMJ. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) has labeled Wexner an alleged Epstein co-conspirator.

WFMJ reviewed state campaign finance records showing donations from Wexner spanning multiple election cycles, but did not specify which politicians received contributions or the individual amounts. Wexner has been a major political donor in Ohio for decades, contributing to candidates of both parties.

Wexner, who employed Epstein as his personal financial adviser, granted Epstein power of attorney over his finances and transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion at 9 East 71st Street to Epstein for $0. Wexner was [subpoenaed by Congress last week](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about his financial relationship with Epstein, the first time he will face congressional questioning under oath about the association.

The report comes as multiple states examine political contributions from individuals named in the 3.5 million pages of Epstein-related documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act, signed November 19, 2025. [A senator in another state faced scrutiny](/news/2026-02-13-senator-blocked-epstein-files-after-receiving-mysterious-donation) after receiving a donation and subsequently blocking transparency legislation.

WFMJ did not report whether any Ohio politicians plan to return the contributions or comment on their acceptance of funds from Wexner. Epstein died on August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted on December 29, 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.
