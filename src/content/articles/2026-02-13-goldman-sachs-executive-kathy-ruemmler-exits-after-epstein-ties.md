**Kathy Ruemmler**, former White House Counsel under President Obama and a top legal executive at Goldman Sachs, is leaving the investment bank following revelations of additional ties to **Jeffrey Epstein**, according to Business Insider. The departure comes as more details emerge about Ruemmler's connections to the disgraced financier.

Ruemmler's relationship with Epstein has drawn scrutiny due to her high-profile role at Goldman Sachs, where she served as General Counsel and a member of the bank's management committee. Her connections to Epstein became a point of controversy for the financial institution, which has sought to distance itself from anyone associated with the convicted sex offender.

## Additional Epstein Connections Surface

Business Insider reports that new information about Ruemmler's ties to Epstein came to light, though the specific nature of these additional connections was not detailed in available reporting. Ruemmler previously disclosed some contact with Epstein, but the emergence of further ties appears to have precipitated her exit from the firm.

The timing of her departure, announced **February 13, 2026**, suggests the revelations prompted either a mutual decision to part ways or pressure on Ruemmler to step down from her senior position at one of Wall Street's most prominent institutions.

## Implications for Corporate Accountability

This development highlights ongoing challenges for corporations and executives dealing with past associations with Epstein, even years after his death in 2019. Goldman Sachs has faced questions about its due diligence regarding executives' personal and professional networks.

Ruemmler's exit may signal heightened corporate sensitivity to Epstein-related controversies as public and regulatory scrutiny continues. The case demonstrates how new information about Epstein's network continues to surface, affecting careers and institutional reputations across finance, law, and politics.

Details about Ruemmler's next position and the full extent of the newly revealed Epstein ties remain unclear.
