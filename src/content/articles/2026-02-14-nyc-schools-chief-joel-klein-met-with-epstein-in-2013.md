Joel Klein, who ran the New York City school system before leading an education technology company, met with Jeffrey Epstein over several months in 2013, according to the New York Times.

The meetings occurred after Klein left his role as schools chancellor and moved to the private sector.

The Times report did not specify the nature or context of the meetings between Klein and Epstein during that period.

## Part of Broader File Review

The disclosure comes from the [New York Times' ongoing investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into millions of documents related to Epstein's network of contacts.

That review has identified connections between Epstein and numerous prominent figures in education, business, and government. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in the files, and [multiple college presidents and professors](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) have been identified in the documents.

Klein's meetings with Epstein took place during 2013, years after Epstein's 2008 conviction.
