**Joel Klein**, who served as chancellor of the New York City Department of Education from 2002 to 2011, met with **Jeffrey Epstein** at least six times over several months in 2013, according to scheduling records and correspondence obtained by the New York Times.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The encounters took place five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for sex in Florida.

Klein, who oversaw the nation's largest public school system with 1.1 million students, had left government to become executive vice president at **Rupert Murdoch**'s News Corp and CEO of its education technology division, Amplify.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Before leading NYC schools under Mayor **Michael Bloomberg**, Klein served as White House deputy counsel and later U.S. assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division under President **Bill Clinton**.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He was once rumored to be in the running for secretary of education under President **Barack Obama**.

## How the Meetings Began

Klein told the Times he connected with Epstein at the request of **Mortimer Zuckerman**, the media and real estate mogul who at the time owned the New York Daily News and U.S. News & World Report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Documents show Epstein hosted a dinner party at his Manhattan townhouse where Klein and Zuckerman were among the guests. Subsequent breakfast and afternoon meetings followed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

In one exchange, Epstein invited Klein and his wife to a birthday party he was organizing for filmmaker **Woody Allen**, asking Klein for suggestions on guests who were "not ponderous."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> In preparation for another meeting, Epstein contacted a technology-industry figure about "edutainment games" before sitting down with Klein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein also introduced Klein to **Joichi Ito**, a venture capitalist and technologist who then led the MIT Media Lab. Klein subsequently wrote to Ito expressing interest in discussing Amplify's work, saying he reached out because Ito was a "distinguished technologist."<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Ito resigned from MIT and from the board of the New York Times Company in September 2019 after reporting revealed his financial ties to Epstein.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Klein's Statement

Klein said he never met Epstein anywhere other than at the financier's New York residence and that he had no further contact with Epstein after late 2013.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Amplify, now an independent company, said it had not known Klein met with Epstein during that period.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

No victims have alleged they were recruited from a New York City public school during Klein's tenure, and Klein has not been accused of wrongdoing.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Part of Broader File Review

The disclosure comes from the [New York Times' ongoing investigation](/news/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files/) into the 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos released under the Epstein Transparency Act, signed Nov. 19, 2025.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

That review has surfaced contacts between Epstein and figures across education, business, and government. [**Kathryn Ruemmler**, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files/) after being named in the files.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> [Multiple college presidents and professors](/news/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout/) have been identified in the documents, and Epstein [used Nobel Prize access to cultivate his elite network](/news/2026-02-14-epstein-used-nobel-prize-access-to-lure-elite-network-files-show/), according to separate reporting.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Klein's meetings took place during a period when Epstein, a registered sex offender since 2008, continued to socialize with prominent figures in politics, academia, and finance. [Consultants pitched Epstein's access to New York Democrats](/news/2026-02-14-consultants-pitched-epstein-access-to-ny-democrats-for-donations/) in exchange for campaign donations during this same timeframe.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> Epstein died Aug. 10, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in what officials ruled a suicide.
