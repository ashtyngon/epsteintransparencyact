Garcia's statement focuses on interviews the FBI conducted with the Trump accuser, which the congressman indicated should have been included in records released under the new transparency law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Epstein Transparency Act mandates disclosure of records related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Department of Justice has not publicly addressed Garcia's claim about the withheld interviews.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Transparency Act Requirements

The Epstein Transparency Act requires federal agencies to declassify and release documents related to Epstein's crimes, associates, and connections to powerful figures.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The FBI began releasing records under the law earlier this year, though Garcia's statement suggests the scope of the initial release may be incomplete.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Garcia, who represents California's 42nd congressional district, sits on committees with oversight authority over the Justice Department.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His public statement indicates congressional Democrats intend to scrutinize whether agencies are meeting their legal obligations under the statute.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The law passed both chambers of Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support before being signed into law in January 2025.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Document Release Scrutiny

[Other lawmakers have raised concerns](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) about whether the DOJ's document releases meet the full requirements of the transparency law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Garcia's specific reference to FBI interviews with a Trump accuser adds a new dimension to questions about which records federal agencies have disclosed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The extent of Epstein's connections to powerful figures in politics, business, and entertainment has remained a subject of intense public interest since his arrest in July 2019.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Garcia's statement indicates that questions about the scope of government records related to those connections continue as agencies work to comply with disclosure requirements.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Epstein Case Background

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody on August 10, 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on five counts including sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> She was sentenced in June 2022 to 20 years in federal prison and is currently incarcerated.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida and served 13 months in a county jail under a controversial plea agreement that shielded him and potential co-conspirators from federal prosecution.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
