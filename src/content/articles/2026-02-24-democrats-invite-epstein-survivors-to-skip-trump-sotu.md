Multiple Democratic members of Congress invited survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse as their guests to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday evening, according to AOL.com.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Dozens of Democratic lawmakers also announced plans to skip the speech entirely.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The invitations come as Congress continues to grapple with documents released under the Epstein Transparency Act, which Trump signed into law in January.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The decision by Democrats to bring Epstein survivors as guests represents an effort to spotlight the case during one of the year's highest-profile political events.

## Guest Invitations to Presidential Address

Members of Congress traditionally receive one or two guest tickets to the annual State of the Union address.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Lawmakers frequently use these invitations to highlight constituents or draw attention to policy priorities by selecting guests whose presence makes a political statement.

The practice has been used by both parties to emphasize issues ranging from health care and immigration to veterans' affairs and criminal justice reform. The guests typically sit in the House gallery during the address and are sometimes acknowledged during the speech itself.

AOL.com reported that several Democrats extended invitations to Epstein survivors for Tuesday's address.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Epstein Transparency Act Implementation

Trump signed the Epstein Transparency Act into law in January, requiring federal agencies to declassify and release documents related to Epstein's crimes and network of associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The law passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support in a 382-35 vote in December 2024.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The act mandates that the Department of Justice, FBI, and other federal agencies review their files and release records connected to Epstein's criminal activities and the individuals in his network. Agencies were given specific deadlines to begin producing documents for public release.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), one of the law's primary sponsors, has [called the released documents evidence of a "much bigger" criminal network](/news/2026-02-24-rep-mace-epstein-files-reveal-much-bigger-criminal-network) than previously known. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) has [stated that the Department of Justice withheld FBI interviews with a Trump accuser](/news/2026-02-24-rep-garcia-doj-withheld-fbi-interviews-with-trump-accuser-in-epstein-files) in the initial document releases.

## Case Background

Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His former associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in December 2021 on charges of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges of soliciting a minor under a controversial plea agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution at the time.
