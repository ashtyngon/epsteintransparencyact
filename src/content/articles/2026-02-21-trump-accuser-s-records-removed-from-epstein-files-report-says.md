# Records Show Woman's Allegations Against Trump Removed From Epstein Document Release

A woman who made allegations of sexual misconduct involving Donald Trump as a minor had her records removed from recently released Epstein-related documents, according to a new report.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The removal comes as Attorney General Pam Bondi faces criticism for stating that all Epstein files have been made public, a claim that survivors' advocates and government transparency groups dispute.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The woman, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, had what sources described as a "credible accusation" regarding Trump and alleged conduct when she was a minor.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Her records were removed from the document trove before public release.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The development adds to growing scrutiny over which Epstein-related records federal agencies have released and which remain withheld. Attorney General Bondi said during a Feb. 15 statement that all Epstein files in the government's possession have been released to the public.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Multiple advocacy organizations and transparency groups have challenged that assertion, saying thousands of pages of FBI investigative records, State Department cables, and other documents remain classified or unreleased.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Maxwell Legal Fight Over Additional Documents

Ghislaine Maxwell is fighting the release of approximately 90,000 pages of documents from Virginia Giuffre's civil defamation lawsuit against her, according to court filings.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The documents remain under seal despite the conclusion of Maxwell's criminal trial and her current federal prison sentence.

Giuffre said in the civil case that Epstein had trafficked her to other men, including former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Maxwell's legal team has filed objections to the document release with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The civil defamation case was settled in 2017, but the bulk of discovery materials and depositions have remained sealed.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Legal experts have noted that civil discovery often contains witness statements, financial records, and travel logs not included in criminal proceedings.

Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal sex trafficking charges related to her role in Epstein's abuse of minor girls. She is currently serving a 20-year sentence at a federal correctional facility in Florida.

## Bondi Statement Draws Criticism

Attorney General Bondi's Feb. 15 statement that "all Epstein files have been released" drew immediate criticism from transparency advocates and survivors' groups.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The BBC reported that multiple organizations tracking the Epstein case have documented that substantial portions of federal investigative records remain unreleased.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The Department of Justice has not specified which agencies conducted reviews under the Epstein Transparency Act or how many pages of documents each agency holds. The law, signed in December 2024, required federal agencies to review their Epstein-related records and release documents with limited exemptions for national security and ongoing investigations.

FBI field offices in New York, Miami, and Albuquerque conducted investigations into Epstein's activities over two decades. The bureau has not publicly stated how many pages of investigative files it reviewed or how many it has released under the transparency law.

State Department records related to Epstein's international travel and visa applications for foreign nationals who worked at his properties have also not been released. The department has cited privacy exemptions in response to Freedom of Information Act requests for these materials.

## Prince Andrew Case Adds Pressure

The recent arrest of Prince Andrew on document-sharing charges has intensified focus on what records remain sealed in the Epstein case.<sup>[14](#ref-14)</sup> British authorities charged Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with sharing confidential legal documents related to his settlement with Virginia Giuffre.<sup>[14](#ref-14)</sup>

Scotland Yard has expanded its investigation to include questioning of Andrew's former protection officers about his contacts with Epstein.<sup>[10](#ref-10)</sup> The Metropolitan Police Service confirmed that detectives are interviewing members of the Royal Protection Command who were assigned to Andrew during the period when he maintained a friendship with Epstein.

King Charles has publicly distanced himself from his brother over the Epstein connections, according to statements from Buckingham Palace.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup> The U.K. Parliament is considering legislation to remove Andrew from the line of royal succession.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

## Missing Document Categories

The categories of Epstein-related documents that remain unreleased or heavily redacted include FBI surveillance logs, grand jury materials from Florida state proceedings, Treasury Department financial intelligence reports, and correspondence between federal prosecutors in Florida and New York. The Justice Department has not provided a comprehensive accounting of which document categories it has reviewed or released.

Federal law enforcement conducted surveillance of Epstein's residences in New York, Palm Beach, and New Mexico over multiple years. FBI field office logs from those surveillance operations have not been released. Financial intelligence reports filed by banks under suspicious activity reporting requirements also remain sealed.

Grand jury materials from the 2006-2008 Florida state investigation remain under court seal. A Florida judge denied requests to unseal those records in 2023, citing grand jury secrecy rules. Federal prosecutors' files from the controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement also have not been made public.

The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network received multiple suspicious activity reports from banks regarding wire transfers connected to Epstein's accounts. Those reports typically include transaction details, beneficiary information, and investigative summaries. The department has not released any such reports related to Epstein.
