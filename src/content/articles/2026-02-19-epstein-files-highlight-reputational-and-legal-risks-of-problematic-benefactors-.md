A legal analysis published by law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom warns that document releases related to Jeffrey Epstein expose significant reputational and legal risks for institutions that accepted donations from problematic benefactors.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The analysis highlights how Epstein-related documents have subjected universities, nonprofits, and other organizations to scrutiny over their relationships with the financier, who was convicted of sex trafficking crimes.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Organizations face potential legal exposure beyond reputational damage when accepting funds from donors later revealed to have engaged in criminal activity, according to the Skadden analysis.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The firm's attorneys note that institutions may need to review their due diligence procedures for vetting major donors and benefactors.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Universities Face Scrutiny

MIT, Harvard University, and other academic organizations have faced questions about millions of dollars in donations they received from Epstein over multiple years.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Several universities have faced lawsuits from victims who allege the institutions enabled Epstein's crimes by maintaining relationships with him after his 2008 conviction on solicitation charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Financial records show Epstein donated at least $7.5 million to MIT through various channels, with some donations coming after his 2008 guilty plea.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The university's president resigned in 2020 amid controversy over the institution's acceptance of Epstein's money and efforts to conceal his involvement.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Epstein Transparency Act, which became federal law, has triggered reviews of government records related to Epstein's activities and associations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Additional court-ordered releases have made public thousands of pages of documents detailing Epstein's connections to prominent individuals and institutions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Legal Recommendations

The Skadden analysis advises organizations to implement enhanced screening procedures for major donors and to establish clear policies for addressing situations where a benefactor's conduct raises ethical or legal concerns.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The firm recommends that institutions consider forming committees to evaluate potentially problematic donations and create protocols for returning funds when appropriate.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Legal experts quoted in the analysis note that institutions may face derivative liability claims if they are shown to have ignored warning signs about a donor's criminal activity.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Organizations could also face regulatory scrutiny if they fail to report suspicious financial activity or maintain relationships with individuals under investigation.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Banking Settlements

The financial services industry has confronted questions about Epstein's banking relationships. JPMorgan Chase reached a $290 million settlement with Epstein victims in 2023 over allegations the bank facilitated his sex trafficking operation by maintaining his accounts despite internal warnings.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Deutsche Bank separately agreed to a $75 million settlement with victims over similar claims.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Nonprofit organizations have begun reviewing their donor acceptance policies in response to the Epstein case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Several foundations have established ethics committees to evaluate gifts from high-net-worth individuals with potential reputational risks.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Skadden analysis emphasizes that institutions should document their decision-making processes regarding donor relationships and maintain clear records of any due diligence conducted on major benefactors.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
