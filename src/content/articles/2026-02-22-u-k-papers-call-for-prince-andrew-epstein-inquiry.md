Multiple British newspapers called for an investigation into Prince Andrew's connections to Jeffrey Epstein in their Sunday editions, according to a BBC News review of the day's front pages.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The BBC's roundup of Sunday newspaper coverage noted that several publications featured stories demanding a probe into the Duke of York's ties to the convicted sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The Sunday coverage also highlighted the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with papers featuring stories about Ukrainian defenses against Russian drone attacks.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The newspaper calls followed [Prince Andrew's arrest](/news/2026-02-22-police-widen-prince-andrew-investigation-after-epstein-files-arrest) by Metropolitan Police earlier this month in connection with the ongoing Epstein investigation.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> 

[Scotland Yard announced last week](/news/2026-02-20-scotland-yard-expands-andrew-probe-questions-protection-officers-on-epstein-link) that it had expanded its investigation to include questioning protection officers who accompanied Andrew during visits connected to Epstein.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Following Andrew's arrest, King Charles III publicly distanced himself from his brother, with Buckingham Palace announcing that Andrew would no longer use royal titles or carry out royal duties.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The U.K. government has also considered removing Andrew from the line of succession to the throne.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

The Metropolitan Police had previously declined to investigate Andrew in 2021, stating there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges at that time. The force reopened its investigation following the release of thousands of pages of previously sealed court documents related to Epstein's criminal case.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Andrew has faced years of scrutiny over his friendship with Epstein, which included multiple visits to the financier's properties. Court documents have detailed allegations against Andrew, including testimony from Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked to Andrew when she was 17 years old. Andrew has denied the allegations.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup>
