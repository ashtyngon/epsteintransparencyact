At least nine investigations have been initiated in eight countries and within the European Union's anti-fraud unit following the U.S. release of Epstein-related documents, NBC News reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The wave of international inquiries marks a significant response by foreign governments to information contained in records released under the Epstein Transparency Act.

The international action contrasts with mounting congressional criticism of the pace and scope of domestic investigations in the United States. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) said earlier this month that the Epstein files reveal a "much bigger" criminal network than previously understood.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) stated that the Department of Justice withheld FBI interviews with a Trump accuser from the released Epstein files.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## International Probes Span Multiple Jurisdictions

NBC News reported that the investigations span multiple jurisdictions across Europe and other regions, with the EU's anti-fraud unit among the entities launching formal inquiries.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The involvement of the EU's anti-fraud office indicates potential examination of financial irregularities or cross-border activities within European Union member states.

The Epstein Transparency Act, which was signed into law earlier this year, mandated the declassification and public release of government records related to Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The FBI began its review of Epstein-related records under the new law in recent weeks.<sup>[5](#ref-5)</sup>

Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor. He died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

## Domestic Scrutiny Over Document Handling

The Department of Justice has faced scrutiny over the handling of Epstein-related records. The DOJ launched a review of Epstein records after documents related to former President Donald Trump went missing from the files.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

Rep. Mace has demanded that the CIA release Epstein documents, expanding pressure beyond the Justice Department to other federal agencies that may hold relevant records.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> Her statements about a "much bigger" criminal network suggest lawmakers believe significant information remains undisclosed in already-released documents.

The involvement of high-profile political figures in ongoing legal proceedings has intensified public and congressional interest in the case. Bill Clinton is scheduled for a deposition in the Epstein probe,<sup>[8](#ref-8)</sup> while Hillary Clinton has been subpoenaed for closed-door testimony.<sup>[9](#ref-9)</sup>

## Emerging Connections From Document Releases

The international investigations follow the release of documents that have implicated multiple individuals with ties to Epstein's network. A U.S. Customs inspector visited Epstein's island twice, the Post and Courier reported, representing one example of previously undisclosed connections emerging from the document releases.<sup>[10](#ref-10)</sup>

The case has also generated significant public attention, though questions have been raised about the quality of some coverage. A popular Epstein files podcast was revealed to be entirely AI-generated, highlighting concerns about misinformation in reporting on the case.<sup>[11](#ref-11)</sup>

Foreign governments have moved forward with formal inquiries based on information contained in the U.S. document releases, demonstrating that the scope of Epstein's activities and network extended across multiple international jurisdictions. The EU's anti-fraud unit operates independently of member state investigations, suggesting at least one inquiry at the European level alongside separate national probes in individual countries.
