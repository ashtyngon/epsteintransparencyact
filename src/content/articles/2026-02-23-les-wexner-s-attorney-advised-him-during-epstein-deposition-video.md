## Wexner's Financial Relationship With Epstein

Epstein managed Wexner's personal finances and held power of attorney over his business affairs during the 1980s and 1990s, giving him control over significant assets belonging to the Ohio billionaire.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The extent of this financial authority has drawn scrutiny from investigators and journalists examining Epstein's network.

Wexner has publicly stated he was unaware of Epstein's sex trafficking operation and severed ties with him after learning of his conduct. [Congress subpoenaed Wexner in February 2026](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about the relationship.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Context of the 2009 Deposition

The 2009 civil deposition occurred in the aftermath of Epstein's 2008 plea deal, when he pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida related to soliciting prostitution from a minor. Epstein served 13 months in a county jail under a controversial plea agreement that allowed him to continue working during the day.

During this period, multiple civil lawsuits were filed by victims seeking damages. Various individuals connected to Epstein were deposed as part of discovery in these cases. Depositions are sworn testimony taken outside of court, where attorneys question witnesses under oath to gather evidence for trial.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The release of deposition footage and documents from this era has accelerated in recent years as courts have unsealed records related to Epstein's criminal enterprise. Video recordings of depositions, when available, provide additional context beyond written transcripts by capturing witness demeanor and interactions with counsel.

## Recent Document Releases

Wexner's testimony has drawn attention given his wealth, prominence in American business, and the extensive financial relationship he maintained with Epstein. The Columbus Dispatch's publication of this video adds to documentary evidence being made available to the public regarding Epstein's relationships with powerful figures in business, politics, and society.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The 2009 deposition footage documents Wexner's sworn testimony about the relationship during the period when Epstein's criminal conduct was beginning to face legal consequences, before the full scope of his sex trafficking operation became public.
