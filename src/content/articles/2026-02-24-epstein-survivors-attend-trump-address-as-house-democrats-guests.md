Several survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation will attend President Donald Trump's address to a joint session of Congress as guests of Democratic House members, The Source Magazine reported.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The survivors are being hosted by Democratic representatives, marking a rare moment of Epstein case visibility during a major political event.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The report does not specify which Democratic members extended the invitations or identify the survivors by name.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Trump's scheduled address to Congress comes as the Epstein case continues to generate scrutiny of powerful figures who associated with the financier before his death in federal custody.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Congressional Guest Traditions

Members of Congress routinely invite guests to presidential addresses as a means of drawing national attention to specific issues or policy priorities. Guest selections often reflect lawmakers' legislative focus areas or causes they believe warrant greater public awareness.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Source Magazine report does not detail whether the survivors plan to speak publicly about their attendance or what specific message Democratic members hope to convey through the invitations.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Presidential addresses to joint sessions of Congress are among the highest-profile political events of the year, with remarks broadcast live across major television networks and covered extensively by national media outlets.

## Epstein Case Background

Jeffrey Epstein was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida. He served 13 months in county jail under a widely criticized plea agreement that allowed him work-release privileges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

In July 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. He died by apparent suicide in his Metropolitan Correctional Center cell on August 10, 2019, while awaiting trial.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on charges including sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. She is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence. Maxwell recruited and groomed underage girls for Epstein to abuse over multiple years.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Congress passed the Epstein Transparency Act in December 2024, mandating declassification of federal records related to Epstein's crimes and associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The FBI began its review of Epstein-related records under the new law earlier this year.

Courts have released multiple batches of previously sealed materials from civil cases involving Epstein and Maxwell. These document releases have identified numerous individuals who had contact with Epstein, though appearing in released files does not indicate wrongdoing.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The appearance of survivors at Trump's address occurs as litigation and investigations related to Epstein's criminal network continue in multiple jurisdictions.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
