[Epstein files were found in the suspect's car](/news/2026-02-24-epstein-files-found-in-car-of-mar-a-lago-shooting-suspect) during the investigation, according to separate reports.

## Epstein Case Background

Epstein, a financier with connections to prominent figures in politics, business, and academia, was convicted in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a minor in Florida. He died by apparent suicide in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

His associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. The case has generated sustained public interest due to Epstein's extensive network of high-profile contacts and questions about the scope of his criminal activity.

Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida, has been the site of multiple security incidents in recent years. The estate is protected by Secret Service personnel when Trump is in residence.

## Document Release Efforts

The Epstein Transparency Act passed both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support and established a review board to oversee the declassification process. The FBI announced in January that it had begun its review of Epstein-related materials in compliance with the new law.

The FBI has also begun processing materials related to other Epstein associates and locations connected to his activities. Multiple federal agencies maintain records from investigations spanning more than a decade.
