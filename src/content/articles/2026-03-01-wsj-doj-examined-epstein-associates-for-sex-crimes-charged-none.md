The Department of Justice examined multiple men in Jeffrey Epstein's social and business network who faced allegations of sex crimes but did not charge any of them, according to The Wall Street Journal.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Journal reported that federal prosecutors reviewed cases involving men connected to Epstein who were accused of sexual offenses.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Despite the examinations, none of these individuals faced federal charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Federal Epstein Prosecutions

The Justice Department has faced sustained criticism for its handling of Epstein-related investigations across multiple administrations. Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida on state charges of soliciting a minor under a controversial plea agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution at that time.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

That non-prosecution agreement remained in place for more than a decade. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York ultimately charged Epstein with sex trafficking in July 2019.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> He died in his Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 before standing trial.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Document Release and Congressional Oversight

The Epstein Transparency Act, which became federal law in 2025, requires government agencies to review and release documents related to Epstein's activities and associates.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The [FBI began its review of Epstein-related records](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the new law earlier this year.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Wall Street Journal's report emerges as multiple congressional committees have sought testimony and documents related to Epstein's network of contacts. [Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) stated in February that the Epstein files reveal a "much bigger" criminal network](/news/2026-02-24-rep-mace-epstein-files-reveal-much-bigger-criminal-network) than previously understood.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The investigations spanned Epstein's decades-long operation, which involved trafficking underage girls to his properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Prosecutors have stated that Epstein's crimes involved dozens of victims and continued from at least 2002 through 2005.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
