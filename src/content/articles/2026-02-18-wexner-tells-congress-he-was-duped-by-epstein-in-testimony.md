**Les Wexner**, the billionaire retail tycoon and longtime financial benefactor of Jeffrey Epstein, testified before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, telling members he was "duped by a world-class con man," according to a [statement released](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/cms/prod_cms_alt/file/2026/02/18/f4bef550-dcde-4d79-97fa-9805df890875/statement_of_leslie_h._wexner.pdf) ahead of his deposition.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The closed-door deposition marked a significant step in Congress's investigation into Epstein's network of financial and social connections.

Wexner, whose wealth helped fuel Epstein's fortune, described himself in his statement to Democratic members of the committee as "an ethical man, philanthropist and community builder."<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> Members of the House Oversight Committee deposed the retail billionaire as part of the panel's ongoing investigation into Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup><sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> Here's what he said about specific aspects of his relationship with the disgraced pedophile. 


###### On Trusting Epstein and the Deception

- "I was naïve, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein. He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide."
- "What is so clear only now is that Epstein lived a double life. He was clever, diabolical, and a master manipulator."
- "Little did I realize that, from the very start, Epstein was conniving to gain my trust."

###### On Epstein's Public Facade

- "Over the course of many years, he carefully used his acquaintance with important individuals to curate an aura of legitimacy that he then used to expand his network of acquaintances, and apparent credibility, even farther."
- "The side of Epstein that he chose to reveal to me was far different from the predator he eventually was exposed to be."

###### Addressing Specific Rumors and Associations

- "Contrary to rumor, I did not give Epstein the New York townhouse; he purchased it from me for what I was told was the appraised value. After we moved out, I never set foot in that house again."
- "I visited Epstein’s island only once, shortly after he purchased it, when Abigail, our young children, and I stopped for a few hours one morning while we were on a cruise on our boat."

###### On Severing Ties and Financial Theft

- "What I did not anticipate was Epstein misusing the trust I placed in him despite his fiduciary obligation to act in my best interest."
- "Confronted with his financial wrongdoing by Abigail, Epstein agreed to, and did, return a substantial amount of money, even while continuing to maintain his total innocence of any wrongdoing, never dropping the con."
- "Once I learned of his abusive conduct and theft from my family, I never spoke with Epstein again. Never."

###### On the Survivors

- "Before going any further, though, I want to acknowledge the survivors of Epstein’s terrible crimes and the devastation that each of them has endured as a result. The pain he inflicted upon them is unfathomable to me."


The testimony comes amid renewed scrutiny of Wexner's business and personal relationship with Epstein, which became public after [Wexner's name was unredacted in recently released Epstein files](/news/wexner-s-name-unredacted-in-epstein-files-osu-ties-scrutinized).

## Congressional Investigation Expands

The House Oversight Committee set the deposition for Wednesday morning, with House Democrats scheduled to speak publicly afterward.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup> The committee has been investigating Epstein's network following the passage of legislation mandating greater transparency around government records related to the case.

**Rep. Nancy Mace** separately called on the CIA to turn over documents related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, according to reports Wednesday.<sup>[7](#ref-7)</sup> Mace has been a vocal advocate for full disclosure of Epstein-related files, previously [demanding full transparency and pushing for judicial term limits](/news/2026-02-17-rep-mace-demands-full-epstein-files-transparency-pushes-judicial-term-limits).

The timing of Wexner's testimony coincides with international investigations into Epstein's activities. Paris prosecutors opened two Epstein-linked probes Wednesday and called on victims to come forward.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> **Prosecutor Laurence Beccuau** called on victims who may have never spoken up before to file formal complaints or make witness accounts to feed French and foreign investigations.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

## Property Developments

In Texas, former state Senator **Don Huffines**, whose family purchased one of Epstein's former properties, announced plans to convert the New Mexico ranch into a Christian retreat.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup> Huffines, who is running for Texas comptroller, told former Rep. Matt Gaetz on his One America News Network show Tuesday that he plans on turning the property into a Christian retreat.<sup>[6](#ref-6)</sup>

The property, known as Zorro Ranch, was [the subject of New Mexico's first full investigation](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) into Epstein's activities there. [Huffines's family purchased the ranch for $13.4 million](/news/2026-02-16-trump-gop-candidate-s-family-bought-epstein-s-abuse-ranch-for-13-4m), according to previous reports.

## Wexner's Financial Ties to Epstein

Wexner's business relationship with Epstein has been documented in multiple court filings and financial records. The retail magnate granted Epstein power of attorney over his financial affairs during their decades-long association, which ended in 2007. The nature and extent of their financial relationship has been a focus of congressional investigators examining how Epstein built his wealth and maintained his lifestyle.

The House Oversight Committee's investigation represents one of several ongoing inquiries into Epstein's network. The deposition followed months of pressure from lawmakers seeking answers about how Epstein operated and who enabled his activities.

## International Implications

The French investigation announced Wednesday by Prosecutor Beccuau represents an expansion of international scrutiny into Epstein's activities beyond U.S. borders.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The prosecutor specifically encouraged victims to come forward to support both French and foreign investigations.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

The dual investigations opened in Paris follow patterns of international cooperation on Epstein-related cases. [UN experts previously called for investigation into Epstein files and warned of potential crimes against humanity](/news/2026-02-16-un-experts-call-for-investigation-into-epstein-files-warn-of-crimes-against-huma), indicating the global scope of potential criminal activity.

The House Oversight Committee has not announced when it will release findings from Wexner's deposition or whether additional witnesses will be called. Democratic members of the committee were scheduled to speak publicly following the closed-door testimony.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>
