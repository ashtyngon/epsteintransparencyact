Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene responded Tuesday to President Donald Trump calling her a "traitor" by saying she is "not in his cult" and repeating her accusation that Trump is withholding information about late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

"Him calling me that has become a badge of honor because I'm not in his cult, I refused to bow," Greene told reporters, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The Georgia Republican has accused Trump of attempting to conceal Epstein-related records.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Greene previously [called Trump's handling of the Epstein files a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) and [faced death threats over the dispute](/news/2026-02-17-greene-faces-death-threats-over-trump-epstein-files-dispute).

## Greene's Break with Trump

Greene, who formerly served as one of Trump's most vocal congressional supporters, has broken publicly with the president over Epstein document releases. Her Tuesday statement came after Trump publicly labeled her a traitor.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The confrontation between Greene and Trump centers on federal records related to Epstein's criminal activities and network of associates. Greene has demanded full transparency on documents held by federal agencies including the FBI, CIA, and Department of Justice.

The Epstein Transparency Act, signed into law in January 2026, requires federal agencies to review and release Epstein-related records. Multiple lawmakers have criticized the administration's compliance with the law, citing heavy redactions and incomplete document releases.

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges of sex trafficking minors.

Greene's willingness to publicly challenge Trump on the Epstein files issue represents a departure from her previous position as one of his strongest allies in Congress. The former representative has not provided specific evidence to support her claim that Trump is actively hiding information.

Trump has not responded publicly to Greene's Tuesday statement.
