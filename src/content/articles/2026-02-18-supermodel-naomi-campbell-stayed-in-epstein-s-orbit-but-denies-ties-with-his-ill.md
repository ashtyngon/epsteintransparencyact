Supermodel Naomi Campbell denied involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activities, according to Black Enterprise.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Campbell acknowledged knowing Epstein but stated she had no knowledge of or participation in his illegal conduct.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Her statement addresses scrutiny that intensified after she was [named in released Epstein files](/news/2026-02-15-naomi-campbell-s-epstein-ties-exposed-in-released-files) earlier this year.

## Campbell Addresses Epstein Connection

The supermodel's denial comes as individuals connected to Epstein's network continue to face questions about their associations with the convicted sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Officials ruled his death a suicide.

Black Enterprise reported Campbell's denial without providing additional details about the timing or context of her statement.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Campbell built her career as one of the fashion industry's most recognizable figures, rising to prominence in the 1990s. Epstein cultivated connections in fashion, business, and entertainment circles for decades, including relationships that continued after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida.

## Other Epstein Associates Respond

Multiple celebrities, business executives, and political figures have issued statements distancing themselves from Epstein's criminal conduct while acknowledging varying degrees of contact with him. Some have stated they were unaware of his activities, while others said their interactions were limited or occurred before his conviction became public.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime associate, was convicted in December 2021 on five counts related to sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence. Federal prosecutors presented evidence showing she recruited and groomed underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.

Court documents unsealed in December 2023 named numerous individuals who had contact with Epstein. Being named in the documents does not indicate wrongdoing or knowledge of illegal activity.
