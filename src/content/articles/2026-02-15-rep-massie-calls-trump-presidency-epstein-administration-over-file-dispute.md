Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie called President Trump's administration "the Epstein administration" on Sunday, according to The Independent, in his sharpest rebuke yet over the handling of Jeffrey Epstein files.

Massie has emerged as Trump's primary Republican opponent on Epstein file disclosure, circulating a discharge petition in the House to force release of documents over Justice Department objections.

The congressman [previously declared "I Am Not Suicidal"](/articles/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as he pushed for transparency. Last week, he [criticized the Trump DOJ's redactions](/articles/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) in released documents.

## Growing Republican resistance

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene broke with Trump this week, [calling his handling of the files a "political miscalculation"](/articles/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation).

Trump [called for an end to Epstein investigations](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation) earlier this month. Attorney General Bondi has [defended the redactions](/articles/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) during congressional testimony, citing law enforcement and privacy concerns.

## Discharge petition

Massie's discharge petition would bypass committee procedures and force a floor vote on releasing unredacted files. The measure requires 218 signatures to succeed. Massie has not said how many members have signed.

The Epstein Transparency Act became law in January, requiring federal agencies to review and release records. The FBI and DOJ have released multiple document batches, but significant portions remain redacted or withheld.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose [Epstein ties have become a GOP liability](/articles/2026-02-15-commerce-secretary-lutnick-s-epstein-ties-become-gop-liability), has not commented on Massie's characterization.
