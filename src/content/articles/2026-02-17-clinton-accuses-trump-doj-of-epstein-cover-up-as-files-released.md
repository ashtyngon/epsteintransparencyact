**Hillary Clinton** accused the Trump administration of conducting a "cover-up" of Jeffrey Epstein files on **February 17, 2026**, according to The Independent. Her statement came as **President Trump** declared he had been "totally exonerated" in the documents and claimed he has "nothing to hide."

The Justice Department has stated it released all Epstein records in compliance with the **Epstein Transparency Act** signed into law in **2025**. Clinton's allegations directly contradict these assurances, marking a sharp escalation in public disputes over what has and has not been disclosed.

The clash follows weeks of international investigations and multiple resignations, as countries beyond the United States launch their own probes into Epstein's global network.

## Growing International Investigations

Multiple nations have initiated formal investigations into Epstein connections, according to The Independent's James C. Reynolds. The scope extends well beyond U.S. borders, with European authorities among those examining ties to the deceased financier.

**France** [established a special review team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to examine Epstein files for French nationals, according to prior reporting. French prosecutors [launched an investigation into a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) connected to the case.

The **United Kingdom** [created a national police task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to handle trafficking allegations. The UK's top prosecutor stated ["nobody is above the law"](/news/2026-02-15-uk-top-prosecutor-says-nobody-above-law-as-police-probe-prince-andrew) as police began examining **Prince Andrew**.

**New Mexico** [launched its first full investigation](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) into Epstein's **Zorro Ranch**, where alleged abuse occurred. The property was [purchased for $13.4 million](/news/2026-02-16-trump-gop-candidate-s-family-bought-epstein-s-abuse-ranch-for-13-4m) by the family of Trump GOP candidate **Don Huffines**, creating political complications for his Texas comptroller campaign.

## British Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

**Transparency International UK** released an analysis of the **Mandelson-Epstein emails** on **February 16**, examining what they reveal about Britain's lobbying system. The organization's report focused on structural issues exposed by the communications between **Peter Mandelson** and Epstein.

Congress [issued a subpoena to Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) over his Epstein ties in a major probe. The emails showed patterns of access and influence that raised questions about regulatory gaps in British governance.

The analysis comes as multiple British figures face scrutiny. **Sarah Ferguson** [shut down six companies](/news/2026-02-16-sarah-ferguson-shuts-down-6-companies-after-epstein-ties-exposed) after her Epstein ties were exposed in the files. An aide to Prince Andrew [advised Epstein to hide his conviction](/news/2026-02-14-prince-andrew-s-aide-advised-epstein-to-hide-conviction-on-visa-form) on visa forms, according to documents.

## Congressional Access to Unredacted Files

Federal lawmakers from **Minnesota** and **Iowa** are being asked whether they plan to review unredacted Epstein files, according to KTTC Rochester. The question reflects broader congressional debate over access to complete documentation.

Members of Congress have statutory authority to view classified and sensitive documents in secure facilities. However, disclosure about which lawmakers have exercised this authority varies.

[**Rep. Thomas Massie**](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) has been among the most vocal critics of redactions, stating at a hearing that [AG Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing). Massie [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over the files.

[**Rep. Ro Khanna**](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) demanded DOJ "stop protecting predators" in response to redactions. [**Rep. Nancy Mace**](/news/2026-02-16-rep-mace-demands-unredacted-epstein-co-conspirator-files) demanded unredacted co-conspirator files and [pushed for judicial term limits](/news/2026-02-17-rep-mace-demands-full-epstein-files-transparency-pushes-judicial-term-limits) alongside transparency demands.

## Volume of Released Materials Disputed

A [study found the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows), contradicting claims of complete disclosure. The finding directly challenges statements from **Attorney General Pam Bondi**, who [insisted DOJ released "all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed) with full names listed.

[Lawmakers stated Bondi was "mudding" Epstein names](/news/2026-02-15-lawmakers-accuse-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-names-in-doj-letter) in a DOJ letter. [Comedian Tim Dillon blasted Bondi's testimony](/news/2026-02-16-tim-dillon-blasts-bondi-s-epstein-hearing-testimony-completely-unprepared) as "completely unprepared."

**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** [criticized Trump's Epstein files handling](/news/2026-02-16-mtg-criticizes-trump-s-epstein-files-handling-as-political-miscalculation) as a political miscalculation.
