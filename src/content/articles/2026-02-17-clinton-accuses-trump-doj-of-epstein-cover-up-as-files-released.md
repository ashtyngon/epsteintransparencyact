**Hillary Clinton** accused the Trump administration of conducting a "cover-up" of Jeffrey Epstein files on **February 17, 2026**, according to The Independent. Her statement came as **President Trump** declared he had been "totally exonerated" in the documents and claimed he has "nothing to hide."

The Justice Department has stated it released all Epstein records in compliance with the **Epstein Transparency Act** signed into law in **2025**. Clinton's allegations directly contradict these assurances, marking a sharp escalation in public disputes over what has and has not been disclosed.

The clash follows weeks of international investigations and multiple resignations, as countries beyond the United States launch their own probes into Epstein's global network.

## Growing International Investigations

Multiple nations have initiated formal investigations into Epstein connections, according to The Independent's James C. Reynolds. The scope extends well beyond U.S. borders, with European authorities among those examining ties to the deceased financier.

**France** [established a special review team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to examine Epstein files for French nationals, according to prior reporting. French prosecutors [launched an investigation into a diplomat](/news/2026-02-15-french-prosecutors-investigate-diplomat-in-epstein-probe) connected to the case.

The **United Kingdom** [created a national police task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to handle trafficking allegations. The UK's top prosecutor stated "nobody is above the law" as police began examining **Prince Andrew**.

**New Mexico** launched its first full investigation into Epstein's **Zorro Ranch**, where alleged abuse occurred. The property was purchased for $13.4 million by the family of Trump GOP candidate **Don Huffines**, creating political complications for his Texas comptroller campaign.

## British Lobbying System Under Scrutiny

**Transparency International UK** released an analysis of the **Mandelson-Epstein emails** on **February 16**, examining what they reveal about Britain's lobbying system. The organization's report focused on structural issues exposed by the communications between **Peter Mandelson** and Epstein.

Congress issued a subpoena to Mandelson over his Epstein ties in a major probe. The emails showed patterns of access and influence that raised questions about regulatory gaps in British governance.

The analysis comes as multiple British figures face scrutiny. **Sarah Ferguson** shut down six companies after her Epstein ties were exposed in the files. An aide to Prince Andrew advised Epstein to hide his conviction on visa forms, according to documents.

## Congressional Access to Unredacted Files

Federal lawmakers from **Minnesota** and **Iowa** are being asked whether they plan to review unredacted Epstein files, according to KTTC Rochester. The question reflects broader congressional debate over access to complete documentation.

Members of Congress have statutory authority to view classified and sensitive documents in secure facilities. However, disclosure about which lawmakers have exercised this authority varies.

**Rep. Thomas Massie** has been among the most vocal critics of redactions, stating at a hearing that AG Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors. Massie declared "I am not suicidal" as pressure mounted over the files.

**Rep. Ro Khanna** demanded DOJ "stop protecting predators" in response to redactions. **Rep. Nancy Mace** demanded unredacted co-conspirator files and pushed for judicial term limits alongside transparency demands.

## Volume of Released Materials Disputed

A study found the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files, contradicting claims of complete disclosure. The finding directly challenges statements from **Attorney General Pam Bondi**, who insisted DOJ released "all" Epstein files with full names listed.

Congress accused Bondi of "mudding" the Epstein list by including deceased celebrities. Bondi named dead celebrities in her **300-name list** released **February 15**.

Lawmakers stated Bondi was "mudding" Epstein names in a DOJ letter. Comedian Tim Dillon blasted Bondi's testimony as "completely unprepared."

**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene** criticized Trump's Epstein files handling as a political miscalculation. Greene faced death threats over the dispute with Trump on the files.

## Recent High-Profile Resignations

**Casey Wasserman** sold his agency after Epstein files exposed his ties. The Olympic chief exited after Maxwell email revelations. The **Los Angeles mayor** demanded Wasserman step down from Olympic duties over Maxwell links.

**Tom Pritzker**, Hyatt heir, stepped down over Epstein contact links. **Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned** after being named in the files.

The Dubai Ports chief resigned after hundreds of secret emails were exposed. An ex-Clifford Chance lawyer's hidden ties were revealed in emails.

## Political Fallout in U.S.

**Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's** Epstein ties became a GOP liability, with GOP senators viewing his contacts as a political problem.

Documents showed Epstein was invited to congressional galas years after his arrest. Consultants pitched Epstein access to NY Democrats for campaign donations.

A senator blocked Epstein files after receiving a mysterious donation, according to prior reporting. Ohio politicians received campaign funds from Wexner, Epstein's longtime associate.

## University and Business Connections

Files showed Epstein pulled strings at the University of Alabama. College presidents and professors were named in the fallout.

**Columbia** removed staff who facilitated an Epstein-linked dental school admission. Craven County Schools responded to student records found in files.

**NYC Schools Chief Joel Klein** met with Epstein in 2013, documents revealed. **Leon Black** was named in files, causing schools to cancel photo day at institutions he supported.

A Bank of America Epstein trafficking lawsuit was allowed to proceed by a court. **Les Wexner** was subpoenaed to testify on Epstein ties.

## Media and Cultural Figures

**Piers Morgan** was named 29 times in Epstein files. **Naomi Campbell's** Epstein ties were exposed, with secret ties revealed.

**Media mogul Michael Ferro** canceled a last-minute Epstein meeting, emails revealed. **Trump insider Tom Barrack** was named in files.

**Steve Bannon** discussed "taking down" Pope Francis with Epstein, according to DOJ files. The New York Times reported Bannon texted with Epstein despite his toxicity.

## International Names and Nobel Prize Access

**Nobel chief Thorbjørn Jagland** got gifts from Epstein, emails revealed. Files showed Epstein used Nobel Prize access to lure his elite network.

An Indian businessman, minister and guru were named in files. **Orioles owner David Rubenstein** was named in documents.

A Staten Island search uncovered hundreds of hits in the files. A South Carolina woman was named in the release.

## Survivor Testimony and Clemency Offer

**Epstein survivor Juliette Bryant** stated she "thought I was going to die." Her testimony provided direct accounts of abuse within Epstein's network.

**Ghislaine Maxwell** offered to reveal "truth" in exchange for clemency from prison. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking charges. Her offer to cooperate has not been accepted by federal authorities.

## Documents and Public Investigations

**The New York Times** launched a major investigation into millions of Epstein files. An NYT investigation revealed how elite immunity protected Epstein.

**A new platform called JeffTube** makes DOJ Epstein files easier to browse. Epstein emails spread across social media in a viral leak.

Newly released video from Epstein's office was revealed in the latest files dump. The FBI holds thousands of files on a Detroit millionaire's island operation connected to the case.
