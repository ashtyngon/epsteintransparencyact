The Paris prosecutor's office announced Saturday it is setting up a special team of magistrates to analyze evidence that could implicate French nationals in crimes connected to Jeffrey Epstein.

The team will review documents released by U.S. authorities that identify prominent French figures in Epstein's network. The prosecutor's office will also re-examine the case of Jean-Luc Brunel, a former French modeling agency executive and close associate of Epstein who died in custody in 2022.

## Brunel Case Under Review

The prosecutor's office said it would "thoroughly re-examine" the Brunel case. Brunel ran a French modeling agency and maintained close ties to Epstein before his death in custody in 2022.

The announcement provided no details on which French nationals appear in the U.S. documents or what evidence the magistrates will review.

## Document Release Prompts Action

The French response follows the [release of millions of Epstein-related files](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) by U.S. authorities. The documents have exposed Epstein's connections to individuals across multiple countries.

The Paris prosecutor's office did not specify a timeline for the team's review or indicate whether the investigation could lead to charges against French nationals.
