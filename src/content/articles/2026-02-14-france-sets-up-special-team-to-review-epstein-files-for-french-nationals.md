The Paris prosecutor's office announced Saturday it is setting up a special team of magistrates to analyze evidence that could implicate French nationals in crimes connected to Jeffrey Epstein.

The team will review documents released by U.S. authorities under the Epstein Transparency Act—signed November 19, 2025—that identify prominent French figures in Epstein's network. The prosecutor's office will also re-examine the case of Jean-Luc Brunel, a former French modeling agency executive and close associate of Epstein who was found dead in his Paris jail cell on February 19, 2022, while awaiting trial on charges of rape and sexual assault of minors.

## Brunel Case Under Review

The prosecutor's office said it would thoroughly re-examine the Brunel case. Brunel founded the MC2 modeling agency and was accused of using it to procure young women for Epstein. He was arrested in December 2020 at Charles de Gaulle Airport and charged with rape of minors, sexual assault, and human trafficking. His death in custody—ruled a suicide by hanging—drew immediate comparisons to Epstein's own death on August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.

French prosecutors had been investigating Epstein's activities in France since 2019. Brunel's death effectively ended their primary case, but the newly released U.S. documents may identify additional French nationals who facilitated or participated in Epstein's network.

## Document Release Prompts Action

The French response follows the [release of 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos of Epstein-related files](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law) by U.S. authorities. The DOJ release was mandated by the Transparency Act, which passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously. The documents have exposed Epstein's connections to individuals across multiple countries, including the naming of Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem more than 4,700 times in the files.

Epstein maintained a residence in Paris and frequently traveled to France. Virginia Giuffre and other accusers described being trafficked to locations in France. The new document releases may contain communications, travel records, and financial transactions involving French nationals not previously identified.

The Paris prosecutor's office did not specify a timeline for the team's review or indicate whether the investigation could lead to charges against French nationals.
