British police have set up a national group to handle allegations that Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking of women had ties to Britain and claims against his associates, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

A senior policing source described the expected volume of claims as a "tsunami" following the U.S. release of papers relating to Epstein.

At least three British police forces are currently dealing with allegations triggered by the revelations about Epstein and his associates in documents released in the United States. Police officials expect more claims of wrongdoing.

## UK Connections Under Scrutiny

The national coordination effort comes as [new emails have contradicted Prince Andrew's public statements](/articles/2026-02-13-prince-andrew-s-bbc-claims-unravel-as-new-epstein-emails-surface) about his relationship with Epstein. [Courts in the U.S. have released new batches](/articles/court-releases-new-batch-of-documents) of Epstein-related documents in recent weeks.

The group will handle both allegations about Epstein's trafficking operations with ties to the UK and claims against his associates.

British police have not specified how many allegations are currently under investigation or identified individuals named in those complaints.
