Congressional lawmakers sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing her of "purposefully mudding" the list of names associated with Jeffrey Epstein, according to The Independent.

The letter targets Bondi's approach to public disclosure of individuals connected to Epstein. Bondi recently [named dead celebrities in a public list](/news/2026-02-15-bondi-named-dead-celebrities-in-epstein-email-list) while [defending the completeness of DOJ file releases](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more), prompting criticism that the strategy obscures accountability for living individuals.

## Mounting Congressional Pressure

The letter adds to weeks of bipartisan frustration with DOJ handling of Epstein files. Rep. Thomas Massie [lost confidence in Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) earlier this week and [declared "I am not suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over his advocacy for fuller disclosure.

Rep. Nancy Mace [accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) in released documents. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene [called Trump's handling](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) of the files a "political miscalculation."

[Heavy redactions](/news/2026-02-12-trump-doj-accused-of-epstein-cover-up-over-file-redactions) in released documents prompted accusations of a cover-up. The FBI [explained redactions](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) as necessary to protect ongoing investigations and privacy rights.

## Contrast With International Response

While American officials maintain positions despite file revelations, international consequences have been swift. The Dubai ports chief [resigned after hundreds of emails surfaced](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed). Goldman Sachs' top lawyer [stepped down after being named](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files).

France [established a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review files for French nationals. UK police [launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations.

Bondi has not responded to the congressional letter.
