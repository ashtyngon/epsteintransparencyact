**Peter Mandelson**, former UK ambassador to the United States, has been summoned to testify before Congress over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Two members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent the request Friday, pulling a former foreign diplomat into the expanding investigation.

The summons extends the congressional investigation beyond American executives and officials. Mandelson, who previously served as British Business Secretary and European Commissioner for Trade, is the first foreign ambassador—current or former—called to answer questions about Epstein connections.

## What Congress Wants

The Friday email from committee members requested Mandelson's testimony as part of the panel's investigation into Epstein's activities. The lawmakers did not detail what specific evidence or allegations prompted the summons.

Mandelson's name has appeared in reporting about Epstein's network of contacts, though the full scope of their relationship remains unclear. The committee has requested he testify under oath.

## Expanding Pressure Campaign

The Oversight Committee has subpoenaed or summoned multiple high-profile figures in recent weeks. Billionaire retail magnate Les Wexner was [ordered to testify in Ohio](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) about his financial relationship with Epstein, with one congressman [labeling Wexner a co-conspirator](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) from the House floor.

Multiple executives have been forced out as names surfaced in documents. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after "Uncle Jeffrey" emails became public. A [Dubai ports executive was ousted](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of messages with Epstein emerged.

Congress has also battled the Justice Department over continued redactions. Attorney General Bondi has [faced repeated grilling](/news/2026-02-13-bondi-grilled-on-epstein-files-why-ag-resists-full-document-release) about why DOJ resists releasing full documents, even as the [FBI explained its redaction process](/news/2026-02-13-fbi-explains-why-epstein-files-remain-heavily-redacted) to lawmakers.

## Diplomatic Complications

Mandelson's summons creates potential friction between Washington and London. No sitting or former British ambassador has been called before Congress for questioning related to personal conduct during or after their service.

The UK government has not indicated whether it will encourage Mandelson to cooperate or attempt to shield him from testimony.

Representative Ro Khanna [demanded full name disclosure](/news/2026-02-13-khanna-demands-names-after-major-epstein-associate-steps-down) after the wave of executive resignations, and the committee has moved to compel testimony from individuals linked to Epstein's network.

The committee has not announced a hearing date. Whether Mandelson will appear has not been confirmed. The summons marks the first time the congressional investigation has targeted an international figure.
