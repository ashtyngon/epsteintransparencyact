**Peter Mandelson**, former UK ambassador to the United States, has been asked to testify before Congress about his contacts with Jeffrey Epstein, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Two members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent the request Friday.

Mandelson, who previously served as British Business Secretary and European Commissioner for Trade, is the first foreign ambassador -- current or former -- called to answer questions about Epstein connections before Congress.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## What Congress Requested

The Friday communication from committee members Reps. Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam requested Mandelson's testimony as part of the panel's investigation into Epstein's activities, according to The Hill.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The lawmakers did not publicly detail what specific evidence or allegations prompted the request.

Mandelson's name has appeared in reporting about Epstein's network of contacts, though the full scope of their relationship has not been publicly established.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The committee has requested he testify under oath.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Broader Congressional Investigation

The Oversight Committee has summoned multiple high-profile figures in recent weeks. Billionaire retail magnate Les Wexner was [ordered to testify in Ohio](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) about his financial relationship with Epstein, with one congressman [referring to Wexner as a co-conspirator](/news/2026-02-14-lawmaker-names-6-men-hidden-in-epstein-files-despite-transparency-act) from the House floor.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

Multiple executives have departed after being named in documents. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after emails referring to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey" became public.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> A Dubai ports executive departed after appearing thousands of times in the files.<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

Congress has also pressed the Justice Department over continued redactions. Attorney General Bondi has faced questioning about why DOJ has not released full documents.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Diplomatic Considerations

Mandelson's summons creates potential friction between Washington and London. No sitting or former British ambassador has previously been called before Congress for questioning related to personal conduct during or after their service.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The UK government has not indicated whether it will encourage Mandelson to cooperate.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The committee has not announced a hearing date. Whether Mandelson will appear has not been confirmed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
