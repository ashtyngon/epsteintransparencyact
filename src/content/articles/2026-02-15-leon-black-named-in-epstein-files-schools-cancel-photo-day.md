Schools canceled yearbook photo sessions with a photography company after billionaire Leon Black was named in recently released Epstein files, according to Daily Kos.

Black is the founder of Apollo Global Management. Schools terminated contracts with his photography business following the document release, though the specific institutions have not been publicly identified.

## Pattern of Professional Fallout

The cancellations mark the latest professional consequence for figures named in the files. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer resigned](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in documents. [Casey Wasserman sold his talent agency](/articles/2026-02-14-casey-wasserman-sells-talent-agency-after-ghislaine-maxwell-emails-exposed) after emails with Ghislaine Maxwell surfaced. A [Dubai ports executive stepped down](/articles/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed) after hundreds of emails were exposed.

## Educational Institutions Respond

[Universities have faced Epstein-related scrutiny](/articles/2026-02-14-doj-files-epstein-pulled-strings-at-university-of-alabama), with DOJ files showing Epstein had influence at the University of Alabama. [Multiple college presidents and professors were named](/articles/2026-02-13-college-presidents-professors-named-in-epstein-files-fallout) in earlier document releases.

The school photography cancellations extend that scrutiny to K-12 institutions and their vendor relationships.

Black has not publicly commented on the cancellations.
