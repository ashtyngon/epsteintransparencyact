Rep. Nancy Mace called for complete transparency in the Epstein files and proposed term limits for federal judges during an appearance on ABC Columbia. The South Carolina Republican pledged to "expose" hidden information about the convicted sex offender's network.

"We're going to expose it," Mace said, according to ABC Columbia.

## Congressional Pressure Intensifies

Mace joins a growing list of lawmakers challenging the Justice Department's handling of Epstein-related records. Rep. Thomas Massie has [publicly stated he has lost confidence](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) in Attorney General Pam Bondi's leadership over the files issue. During congressional testimony, Massie [accused Bondi of avoiding eye contact](/news/2026-02-15-massie-bondi-avoided-eye-contact-with-epstein-survivors-at-hearing) with Epstein survivors.

Rep. Ro Khanna has [demanded the DOJ "stop protecting predators"](/news/2026-02-16-khanna-blasts-doj-for-redacting-epstein-files-stop-protecting-predators) and called for unredacted documents. Mace previously [accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) in the files release.

Attorney General Bondi has stated the department released ["all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed) and provided a list of 300 names. A recent analysis found [the Trump DOJ released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows).

## Judicial Term Limits Proposal

Mace also used the ABC Columbia appearance to advocate for term limits on federal judges. Federal judges currently serve lifetime appointments under Article III of the Constitution. Any change would require a constitutional amendment, which demands approval by two-thirds of both chambers of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures.

Documents show [Epstein sympathized with Justice Brett Kavanaugh](/news/2026-02-16-epstein-emails-sex-abuser-sympathized-with-kavanaugh-during-confirmation) during his 2018 confirmation hearings, according to emails released by the DOJ.

## GOP Split Over File Handling

Congressional Republicans have split over the administration's handling of the files. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene [called it a "political miscalculation"](/news/2026-02-14-greene-blasts-trump-s-epstein-file-handling-as-political-miscalculation) by the Trump White House.

The files have triggered resignations across multiple industries. [Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) after being named in documents. [Hyatt heir Tom Pritzker resigned](/news/2026-02-16-hyatt-heir-tom-pritzker-steps-down-over-epstein-contact-links) from his position after contact with Epstein was documented. [Sarah Ferguson shut down six companies](/news/2026-02-16-sarah-ferguson-s-6-companies-to-close-after-epstein-files) following revelations about her ties to the financier.

International authorities have taken action. [France established a special team](/news/2026-02-14-france-sets-up-special-team-to-review-epstein-files-for-french-nationals) to review files for French nationals. [UK police launched a national task force](/news/2026-02-14-uk-police-launch-national-task-force-for-epstein-trafficking-allegations) to investigate trafficking allegations. [New Mexico opened its first full investigation](/news/2026-02-17-new-mexico-launches-first-full-investigation-into-epstein-s-zorro-ranch) into Epstein's Zorro Ranch.

[UN experts have called for an investigation](/news/2026-02-16-un-experts-call-for-investigation-into-epstein-files-warn-of-crimes-against-huma) and warned that the files may document crimes against humanity.

## Congressional Authority

Congress passed the Epstein Transparency Act in 2025, requiring federal agencies to review and release records related to the case. The [FBI began its review](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) following the law's enactment.

Lawmakers have also issued subpoenas. Congress [subpoenaed Peter Mandelson](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-mandelson-over-epstein-ties-in-major-probe) and [Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) to testify about their connections to Epstein.

Mace represents South Carolina's 1st Congressional District and sits on the House Oversight Committee, which has jurisdiction over government transparency matters.
