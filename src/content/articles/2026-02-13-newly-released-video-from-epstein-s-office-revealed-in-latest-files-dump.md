Video footage from inside Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach house has surfaced in the latest batch of court-ordered file releases, according to The Independent.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The footage, captured by a camera in Epstein's office, shows the interior of a workspace in the Palm Beach property. The video emerged as courts continue unsealing material from civil litigation related to Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## The Surveillance Footage

The Independent did not report what the video shows or who appears in it.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Victims' advocates have called for a full accounting of all recorded material in government possession.

Epstein's properties were wired with cameras, according to court filings. The Palm Beach mansion, his New York townhouse at **9 East 71st Street** (transferred to him by **Les Wexner**), his **Zorro Ranch** in Stanley, New Mexico, and his private island **Little St. James** in the U.S. Virgin Islands all had monitoring systems.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> When the FBI raided his Manhattan townhouse on **July 6, 2019**, agents seized hard drives, computers, and digital storage devices, including what prosecutors described as a locked safe containing compact discs labeled with handwritten names.

The status of that material — how much still exists and how much has been analyzed — has not been publicly disclosed.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> This video emerged through civil discovery rather than through the Justice Department's document release process.

## Surveillance Footage and Transparency

Surveillance footage has become a focal point in the debate over Epstein file releases. Victims' lawyers say video evidence could identify additional individuals and corroborate survivor testimony.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The DOJ has stated that some material must remain sealed to protect investigations or privacy.

The emergence of footage through civil cases outside DOJ control has been noted by legal observers as relevant to the department's arguments for keeping such material sealed.

## Broader Context

This video is the latest in a series of releases that have included [names in emails and flight logs](/news/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files), been followed by [departures at major corporations](/news/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), and prompted [congressional subpoenas, including for Les Wexner](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties).<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup><sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>

The New York Times has assigned 24 journalists to review millions of pages of records released under the Epstein Transparency Act.

The Palm Beach mansion was the site of Epstein's 2008 plea deal, negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney **Alexander Acosta**, in which Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor and served 13 months in a county jail with work-release privileges, avoiding federal trafficking charges.

The video became public through a court order in civil litigation, not through the government's document release process.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
