Video footage from inside Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach house has surfaced in the latest batch of court-ordered file releases, according to The Independent.

The footage, captured by a camera in Epstein's office, shows the interior of the workspace where the financier operated his trafficking network for more than a decade. The video emerged as courts continue unsealing material from civil litigation tied to Epstein's crimes.

## The Surveillance Question

The Independent did not report what the video shows or who appears in it. The existence of office surveillance footage has prompted calls from victims' advocates for a full accounting of all recorded material in government possession.

Epstein's homes were wired with cameras. The Palm Beach mansion, his New York townhouse at **9 East 71st Street** (transferred to him by **Les Wexner**), his **Zorro Ranch** in Stanley, New Mexico, and his private island **Little St. James** in the U.S. Virgin Islands all had monitoring systems. When the FBI raided his Manhattan townhouse on **July 6, 2019**, agents seized hard drives, computers, and digital storage devices, including what prosecutors described as a locked safe containing compact discs labeled with handwritten names.

The status of that material—how much still exists and how much has been analyzed—has not been publicly disclosed. This video emerged through civil discovery rather than through the Justice Department's document release process.

## Surveillance Footage and Transparency

Surveillance footage has become a focal point in the fight over Epstein transparency. Victims' lawyers say video evidence could identify additional perpetrators and corroborate survivor testimony. DOJ says some material must stay sealed to protect investigations or privacy.

The emergence of footage through civil cases outside DOJ control has complicated the department's argument for keeping such material sealed. Victims' advocates say the government must either pursue charges based on the evidence or release the material to the public.

## Drip by Drip

This video is the latest in a series of releases that have exposed [high-profile names in emails and flight logs](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files), led to [resignations at major corporations](/articles/2026-02-13-dubai-ports-chief-resigns-after-hundreds-of-secret-epstein-emails-exposed), and triggered [congressional subpoenas for billionaires like Les Wexner](/articles/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties).

The [New York Times is now conducting a major investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) into millions of pages of records becoming available under the Epstein Transparency Act, which [became law earlier this year](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law).

The incremental pace of releases has drawn criticism. This material existed for years before becoming public through court-ordered disclosure.

The Palm Beach mansion was the site of his 2008 sweetheart plea deal, brokered by then-U.S. Attorney **Alexander Acosta**, where Epstein avoided federal trafficking charges by pleading guilty to state prostitution charges and serving just 13 months in a county jail with work-release privileges. Federal prosecutors knew what happened in that house. They cut a deal anyway.

Now, nearly two decades later, we're getting video from inside the office where it all happened — not because the government chose transparency, but because courts are forcing it.
