Rep. Thomas Massie said Attorney General Pam Bondi was "afraid to" look at Epstein survivors at a hearing, according to The Hill.

The Kentucky Republican has become one of the most vocal critics of the Justice Department's handling of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. He previously [declared "I Am Not Suicidal"](/news/2026-02-14-massie-declares-not-suicidal-as-epstein-files-pressure-mounts) as pressure mounted over his demands for transparency and stated he has [lost confidence in Bondi](/news/2026-02-15-massie-loses-confidence-in-ag-bondi-over-epstein-files-clash) over the DOJ's responses to congressional oversight.

## Clash Over File Releases

Bondi has [defended the Justice Department's document releases](/news/2026-02-16-bondi-says-doj-released-all-epstein-files-full-names-listed), telling Congress the DOJ released "all" Epstein files with full names listed. She provided a list of approximately [300 individuals](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release) named in the documents.

Members of Congress accused Bondi of ["mudding" the list](/news/2026-02-15-congress-accuses-bondi-of-mudding-epstein-list-with-dead-celebrities) by including [dead celebrities](/news/2026-02-15-bondi-named-dead-celebrities-in-epstein-email-list) alongside individuals potentially connected to criminal activity.

Massie has [criticized the Trump DOJ](/news/2026-02-15-massie-rips-trump-doj-over-epstein-file-redactions) for maintaining extensive redactions in released materials. Rep. Nancy Mace separately [accused the DOJ of hiding names](/news/2026-02-15-rep-mace-accuses-doj-of-hiding-names-in-epstein-files-release) in the document release.

The tension follows passage of the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which mandated release of government records related to the case.
