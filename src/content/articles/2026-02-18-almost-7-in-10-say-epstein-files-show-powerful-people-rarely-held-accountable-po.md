Nearly 70% of poll respondents believe the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein demonstrates that powerful individuals are rarely held accountable, according to a survey reported by WRIC ABC 8News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The poll reflects widespread public skepticism about whether prominent figures named or referenced in Epstein-related documents will face consequences for their associations with the convicted sex offender.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The survey results come amid ongoing public scrutiny of unsealed court documents and records related to Epstein's criminal activities and his connections to figures in business, politics, and entertainment.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Limited Criminal Prosecutions

The public perception captured in the poll aligns with the limited scope of criminal prosecutions in the Epstein case.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

No other individuals have been criminally charged in connection with Epstein's trafficking operation in the United States, despite hundreds of pages of unsealed court documents naming numerous high-profile individuals who had various degrees of association with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Being named in the documents does not necessarily indicate wrongdoing or criminal activity.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

## Document Releases and Transparency Demands

Multiple batches of documents have been released in recent months.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> A federal judge ordered the unsealing of hundreds of pages of court documents from a 2015 defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Federal agencies continue to implement the [Epstein Transparency Act](/news/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law), which requires the declassification and public release of government records related to Epstein within 180 days of the law's enactment.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The FBI has [begun its review process](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review) under the new law.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Congressional representatives including Rep. Nancy Mace have publicly called for complete transparency regarding all Epstein-related records held by federal agencies.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Investigations continue in multiple jurisdictions, including recent probes launched by French prosecutors.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
