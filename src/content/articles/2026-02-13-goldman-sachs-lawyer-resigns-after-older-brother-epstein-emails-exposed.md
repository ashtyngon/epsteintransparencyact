Kathy Ruemmler, a senior lawyer at Goldman Sachs, has resigned after documents revealed she referred to Jeffrey Epstein as an "older brother" in private emails.

A Goldman Sachs spokesperson confirmed the departure and said Ruemmler "regrets ever knowing him."

The emails came to light as part of the expanding release of Epstein-related records. Ruemmler's use of familial language to describe a convicted sex trafficker raises immediate questions about the nature and depth of their relationship.

## What "Older Brother" Means

Calling someone an "older brother" isn't professional courtesy. It's intimate language that signals trust, affection, and personal closeness.

The emails were private correspondence, not public statements. That makes the phrasing more telling, not less. This is how Ruemmler described Epstein when she thought no one else would read it.

Goldman Sachs hasn't explained when these emails were written, how long the relationship lasted, or what business or personal matters they discussed. The bank's statement focuses narrowly on Ruemmler's regret—not on what the firm knew or should have asked.

## What Remains Unanswered

Wall Street institutions don't just manage money. They manage access, introductions, and legitimacy within elite networks. When senior executives at firms like Goldman Sachs maintained close personal ties to Epstein, they weren't just making poor personal choices. They were potentially opening doors that should have stayed closed.

Goldman Sachs hasn't disclosed whether it reviewed other executives' contacts with Epstein. It hasn't explained whether any firm resources, relationships, or introductions involved the financier. And it hasn't addressed whether anyone at the bank raised concerns about Epstein before his connections became public scandals.

[Similar questions have emerged at other major banks](/articles/2026-02-13-court-allows-bofa-epstein-trafficking-lawsuit-to-proceed), where institutional knowledge of Epstein's activities is now under legal scrutiny.

## The Broader Pattern

Ruemmler's exit is part of a [widening wave of revelations](/articles/2026-02-13-nyt-launches-major-investigation-into-millions-of-epstein-files) as Epstein-related records become public under [the Epstein Transparency Act](/articles/epstein-transparency-act-signed-into-law). Each release surfaces new names and uncomfortable details about who socialized with, worked with, or defended Jeffrey Epstein.

The "older brother" emails forced a resignation. But they also expose the limitations of corporate damage control. Goldman Sachs can accept Ruemmler's departure. It can express regret. What it hasn't done is explain what it knew, when it knew it, or what it did about it.

Those answers matter more than one lawyer's exit.
