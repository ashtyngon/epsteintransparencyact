**Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor**, the brother of King Charles III and formerly known as Prince Andrew, has been arrested over suspected misconduct in public office related to revelations from the Epstein files, according to BBC News.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The arrest marks the first criminal action taken against a member of the British royal family in connection with the Jeffrey Epstein case.

The BBC reported that the arrest occurred on February 19, 2026.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> CBS News confirmed that the charges relate to suspected misconduct in public office.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> No further details about the specific allegations or evidence leading to the arrest were provided in the initial reports.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor previously stepped back from royal duties in 2019 following public scrutiny of his relationship with Epstein. He was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages in January 2022.

## Institutional Ties to Epstein Under Scrutiny

The arrest comes as academic institutions continue to face questions about their relationships with Epstein. **Leon Botstein**, president of **Bard College** in New York, had conversations with Jeffrey Epstein about music, watches, and young female musicians while raising millions of dollars to save his school from closure, according to The New York Times.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The Times reported that Botstein engaged with Epstein during a period when the college president was actively seeking donations.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The newspaper described Botstein as having raised millions to prevent Bard College's closure and as being viewed as a campus savior.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

The specific nature and frequency of Botstein's interactions with Epstein were not detailed in the Times report. The newspaper noted that their conversations included topics such as music, watches, and young female musicians.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>

## Legal and Reputational Risks for Organizations

Legal publication Mondaq reported that the Epstein files highlight reputational and legal risks for organizations that accepted donations or maintained relationships with problematic benefactors.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The publication addressed broader institutional concerns arising from the document releases.

The Mondaq report did not specify which institutions faced particular risks or detail the nature of potential legal exposure. The article appeared on February 19, 2026, the same day as the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>

Universities, cultural institutions, and foundations have faced increased scrutiny since the initial Epstein files were released. Multiple organizations have conducted internal reviews of past donations and relationships.

## Background on Document Releases

The referenced Epstein files stem from multiple sources, including court documents unsealed in recent months and records released under the Epstein Transparency Act. The act, which became law in 2026, mandates the review and public release of government records related to Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, subject to certain privacy and national security exceptions.

Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on charges including sex trafficking of minors.

## International Investigations Continue

The arrest in the United Kingdom occurs as multiple jurisdictions have opened or expanded investigations related to Epstein. French prosecutors announced in February 2026 that they had opened two investigations and urged French victims to come forward with testimony.

UK police previously announced they were assessing trafficking claims related to Stansted Airport. The Metropolitan Police have not commented publicly on the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

No trial date or further court proceedings have been announced in connection with the February 19 arrest. UK law enforcement agencies have not released additional details about the investigation or the evidence supporting the arrest.
