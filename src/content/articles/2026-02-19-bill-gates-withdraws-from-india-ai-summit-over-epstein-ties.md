**Bill Gates** withdrew from a scheduled appearance at an artificial intelligence summit in India as questions about his past association with **Jeffrey Epstein** reemerged in public discourse, according to a report by Anadolu Ajansı.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The withdrawal comes amid broader public scrutiny of individuals connected to the late financier.

Gates had been expected to participate in the AI summit, but his cancellation coincided with renewed attention to his documented meetings with Epstein.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> The report did not specify which summit Gates withdrew from or provide additional details about the timing of the decision.

A **Reuters/Ipsos poll** found that Americans believe the Epstein files demonstrate that powerful individuals receive different treatment under the law.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The poll results reflect public perception of the ongoing document releases related to Epstein's activities and associations.

## Wexner Testimony Prompts Local Transparency Demands

**Les Wexner's** recent deposition has prompted demands for transparency in **New Albany, Ohio**, where the billionaire retail magnate maintains significant business and civic ties, according to 10TV.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The calls for transparency follow Wexner's testimony about his relationship with Epstein.

Wexner previously told Congress he was "duped" by Epstein during their business relationship.<sup>[4](/news/2026-02-18-wexner-tells-congress-he-was-duped-by-epstein-in-testimony)</sup> The L Brands founder had given Epstein power of attorney over his financial affairs before severing the relationship in 2007.

The deposition has generated local attention in New Albany, where Wexner's influence extends to multiple civic and business institutions.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> The 10TV report did not specify which groups or officials are demanding transparency or what specific information they are seeking.

Gates has previously acknowledged meeting with Epstein on multiple occasions after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida. In 2021, **Melinda French Gates** told CBS that her concerns about her then-husband's meetings with Epstein contributed to their divorce. Gates stated at the time that meeting Epstein was a "huge mistake" and said he regretted the association.

The Microsoft co-founder's meetings with Epstein occurred between 2011 and 2014, according to previous reporting. Gates has stated the meetings related to philanthropy discussions, though he cut off contact after concluding no partnership would materialize.

Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Federal prosecutors had accused him of operating a vast network to recruit and abuse dozens of underage girls. His former associate **Ghislaine Maxwell** is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence after being convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll results indicate widespread public skepticism about equal application of justice in cases involving wealthy and influential individuals.<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup> The survey was conducted after recent document releases related to the Epstein case, though the report did not provide specific poll methodology or sample size details.

Gates' withdrawal from the India summit marks his retreat from a high-profile international speaking engagement at a time when artificial intelligence governance and development have become subjects of intense global policy discussion. The billionaire has been an active voice in debates about AI development and safety through his foundation work and public commentary.

The Anadolu Ajansı report did not indicate whether Gates provided a reason for his withdrawal or whether summit organizers offered comment on his absence.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> No replacement speaker was identified in the available reporting.

In New Albany, the specific transparency demands related to Wexner's deposition remain unclear from available reporting.<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup> Wexner has maintained that he had no knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities during their business relationship and that he severed ties when he became aware of concerning behavior.

The FBI has begun reviewing Epstein-related records under the **Epstein Transparency Act**, which was signed into law earlier this year.<sup>[5](/news/fbi-begins-epstein-records-review)</sup> The law mandates declassification and public release of certain government records related to Epstein's activities and associates, subject to specific exceptions for national security and ongoing investigations.
