Les Wexner, the billionaire founder and former CEO of L Brands, sat for a closed-door deposition Wednesday with members of the House Oversight Committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein's criminal network.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

The session was not open to the public, and the committee has not released a transcript of Wexner's testimony.<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> [Other reporting](/news/2026-02-18-les-wexner-denies-knowledge-of-epstein-crimes-in-deposition-with-skeptical-democ) indicates Wexner denied knowledge of Epstein's sex trafficking operation during the questioning.

## Wexner's Ties to Epstein

Wexner's business and personal relationship with Epstein has been under scrutiny since Epstein's 2019 arrest. Epstein managed Wexner's fortune for decades and held power of attorney over portions of his financial affairs. 

The retail magnate transferred his Manhattan townhouse to Epstein in the 1990s. That property later became one of the locations where prosecutors say Epstein abused victims. Epstein also had access to Wexner's private aircraft.

In a 2019 letter to the Wexner Foundation, the billionaire stated he cut ties with Epstein in 2007 after learning of "inappropriate" conduct. Wexner claimed Epstein had misappropriated funds from his family, though he did not detail the full extent of the alleged theft.

## Congressional Scrutiny

The House Oversight Committee has conducted multiple depositions with individuals connected to Epstein as part of its investigation into his network and potential government failures in prosecuting him earlier. [Wexner was subpoenaed](/news/2026-02-13-congress-subpoenas-wexner-billionaire-to-testify-on-epstein-ties) by Congress as part of this probe.

The private nature of Wednesday's deposition means the full details of Wexner's statements remain unavailable to the public. Committee members may choose to disclose portions of his testimony in future hearings or reports.

## Questions About Knowledge

A central question in congressional and public scrutiny is what Wexner knew about Epstein's criminal activities during their years-long association. Wexner has maintained he was unaware of Epstein's sex trafficking operation and that he was himself victimized by Epstein's financial misconduct.

Epstein died in federal custody in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on charges of sex trafficking minors and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
