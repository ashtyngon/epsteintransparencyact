Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the Justice Department's release of Epstein-related documents on February 17 while facing accusations from multiple members of Congress that the agency withheld the majority of files it holds.

Bondi told reporters the DOJ [released "all" Epstein files](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-defends-complete-epstein-file-release-as-lawmakers-demand-more) in its possession and [provided a list of 300 names](/news/2026-02-15-ag-bondi-lists-300-names-in-epstein-files-release). But an independent analysis found the Trump Justice Department [released only 2% of Epstein files](/news/2026-02-16-trump-doj-released-only-2-of-epstein-files-study-shows) held by federal agencies.

## Congressional Backlash Intensifies

Rep. Thomas Massie lost confidence in Bondi over what he described as incomplete releases. During a hearing, Massie said Bondi avoided eye contact with Epstein survivors who attended the proceedings.

Rep. Nancy Mace accused the Justice Department of hiding names in the materials released to date. She demanded unredacted co-conspirator files and said the agency has not complied with transparency requirements.

Rep. Ro Khanna demanded the DOJ stop protecting predators through extensive redactions. Multiple lawmakers accused Bondi of "mudding" the Epstein list after her initial release included dead celebrities and publicly available contact information.

## Two Percent Release Rate

The discrepancy between Bondi's public statements and the documented release rate has drawn criticism from both parties. Bondi defended the complete release during multiple media appearances in recent days.

The FBI explained files remain heavily redacted due to ongoing investigations and privacy concerns. Some legal experts warned that raw file releases could compromise active criminal probes.

State lawmakers in Minnesota and Iowa announced plans to review unredacted files in secure reading rooms, a process not yet available to the public or most members of Congress.

## International Investigations Expand

Multiple jurisdictions launched new probes following the partial file releases. New Mexico initiated its first full investigation into Epstein's Zorro Ranch property. The United Kingdom established a national police task force to examine trafficking allegations. France created a special team to review files for French nationals.

UN experts called for investigation into the files and warned of potential crimes against humanity. Congressional committees issued subpoenas to billionaire Les Wexner and British politician Peter Mandelson to testify about their connections to Epstein.

## Republican Party Split

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Trump's handling of the Epstein files a "political miscalculation" and has faced death threats over her public criticism of the administration's approach.

Former President Bill Clinton accused the Trump Justice Department of conducting an Epstein cover-up during a BBC interview. Trump denied Epstein links and said he has "nothing to hide" regarding the case.

The file release triggered resignations across multiple sectors. Goldman Sachs' top lawyer stepped down after being named in the files. Dubai's ports chief resigned after hundreds of secret emails surfaced. British royal Sarah Ferguson shut down six companies after her Epstein ties were exposed.
