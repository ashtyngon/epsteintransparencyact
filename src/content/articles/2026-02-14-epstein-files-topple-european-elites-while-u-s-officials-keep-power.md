European officials linked to Jeffrey Epstein have resigned or been forced out in recent weeks. American counterparts named in the same documents have kept their jobs.

At least three prominent European figures have stepped down since the latest Epstein files were released. No comparable wave has struck American institutions.

## European Exits

Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman of DP World and one of Dubai's most powerful business figures, [left his position](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties) after hundreds of emails between his associates and Epstein's network surfaced. The port operator's board announced his departure within days.

Peter Mandelson, the British peer and former European trade commissioner, faced a congressional subpoena after his name appeared repeatedly in Epstein's correspondence. Prince Andrew's aide was revealed to have advised Epstein on concealing his criminal conviction on visa applications.

Thorbjørn Jagland, former secretary general of the Council of Europe and chair of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, was named in emails showing he accepted gifts from Epstein.

## The American Exception

David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group and owner of the Baltimore Orioles, appeared in released documents but retains all business positions and board seats.

Les Wexner, Epstein's most significant financial patron, received a congressional subpoena compelling testimony but continues as chairman emeritus of L Brands. Campaign finance records show Ohio politicians received funds from Wexner over multiple election cycles.

Tom Barrack, longtime adviser to former President Trump and chair of Trump's 2017 inaugural committee, was named in Epstein files. He maintains his investment firm and political connections.

Two exceptions: A Goldman Sachs lawyer [resigned after being named](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) in documents, and Casey Wasserman sold his talent agency following exposure of emails with Ghislaine Maxwell.

## Institutional Responses

France established a specialized team within its justice ministry to review files for French nationals. UK police launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations stemming from the documents.

The U.S. Justice Department response has drawn scrutiny. Attorney General Bondi faced congressional questioning about resistance to full document disclosure. The FBI provided explanations for continued redactions, citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.

President Trump [called for ending the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation). Congressional Democrats including Ro Khanna demanded full disclosure of names after the DP World chairman's departure. One senator who blocked Epstein files legislation received donations weeks before the vote, according to campaign finance filings.

The Epstein Transparency Act became law in 2025. Courts continue releasing documents on a rolling schedule.
