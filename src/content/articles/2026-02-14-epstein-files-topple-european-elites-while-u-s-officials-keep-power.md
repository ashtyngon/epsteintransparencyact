European officials linked to Jeffrey Epstein have resigned or been forced out in recent weeks. American counterparts named in the same documents have kept their jobs.

At least three prominent European figures have stepped down since the latest Epstein files were released. No comparable wave has struck American institutions.

## European Exits

Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman of DP World and one of Dubai's most powerful business figures, [left his position](/articles/2026-02-13-dp-world-chair-forced-out-as-epstein-documents-expose-global-ties) after his name appeared more than 4,700 times in released files, including hundreds of emails between his associates and Epstein's network. The port operator's board announced his departure within days.

Peter Mandelson, the British peer and former European trade commissioner, faced a congressional subpoena after his name appeared repeatedly in Epstein's correspondence. Prince Andrew's aide was revealed to have advised Epstein on concealing his criminal conviction on visa applications.

Thorbjørn Jagland, former Norwegian prime minister, former secretary general of the Council of Europe, and former chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, was named in emails showing he accepted gifts from Epstein. Jagland's dual roles in European governance and the Nobel institution made him a particularly valuable contact for Epstein's network-building strategy.

## The American Exception

David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group and owner of the Baltimore Orioles, appeared in released documents but retains all business positions and board seats.

Les Wexner, Epstein's only confirmed financial client and founder of L Brands (parent of Victoria's Secret), received a congressional subpoena compelling testimony but continues as chairman emeritus. Wexner transferred a $77 million Manhattan mansion to Epstein for $0 and granted him power of attorney. Campaign finance records show Ohio politicians received funds from Wexner over multiple election cycles.

Tom Barrack, founder of Colony Capital (now DigitalBridge), longtime adviser to former President Trump, and chairman of Trump's 2017 inaugural committee, was named in Epstein files. He maintains his investment firm and political connections, including his role as U.S. special envoy to the Middle East.

Two exceptions: Kathryn Ruemmler, former Obama White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel, [resigned after being named](/articles/2026-02-13-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer-resigns-after-named-in-epstein-files) in documents that referred to Epstein as "Uncle Jeffrey." Casey Wasserman, LA 2028 Olympics chief and grandson of MCA founder Lew Wasserman, sold his talent agency following exposure of emails with Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted on December 29, 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

## Institutional Responses

France established a specialized team within its justice ministry to review files for French nationals. UK police launched a national task force to investigate trafficking allegations stemming from the documents.

The U.S. Justice Department response has drawn scrutiny. Attorney General Bondi faced congressional questioning about resistance to full document disclosure. The FBI provided explanations for continued redactions, citing ongoing investigations and privacy concerns.

President Trump [called for ending the Epstein investigation](/articles/2026-02-13-trump-calls-for-end-to-epstein-investigation). Congressional Democrats including Ro Khanna demanded full disclosure of names after the DP World chairman's departure. One senator who blocked Epstein files legislation received donations weeks before the vote, according to campaign finance filings.

The Epstein Transparency Act passed the House 427-1 and the Senate unanimously before being signed into law on November 19, 2025. The DOJ has since released 3.5 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos. Courts continue releasing documents on a rolling schedule. Epstein died on August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. Prince Andrew settled with accuser Virginia Giuffre for a reported 12 million pounds in 2022.
