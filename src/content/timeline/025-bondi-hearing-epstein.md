On February 11, 2026, Attorney General Pam Bondi testified before the House Judiciary Committee in one of the most contentious oversight hearings in recent memory. The Epstein files dominated the proceedings, with lawmakers from both parties pressing Bondi on multiple fronts.

## Key Exchanges

**Zero indictments**: Rep. Jerry Nadler noted that the number of Epstein co-conspirators Bondi had indicted was zero. Rep. Ted Lieu pointed out that despite over 1,000 known sex trafficking victims, "you have not held a single man accountable."

**Cover-up accusations**: Rep. Jamie Raskin accused Bondi of "running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice." Even Rep. Thomas Massie — the Republican who co-authored the Transparency Act — accused the DOJ of over-redacting documents while simultaneously leaking survivor identities.

**Maxwell transfer**: Bondi claimed she "learned after the fact" about Maxwell's transfer to the minimum-security prison camp and said she could not identify who ordered it. She told lawmakers that Maxwell "will hopefully die in prison."

**Survivors ignored**: Survivors present in the hearing room raised their hands to indicate that none had been invited to meet with Bondi or the DOJ. Bondi refused to apologize to survivors, calling requests to do so "theatrics."

## The Bondi Paradox

The hearing laid bare what critics called the "Bondi paradox" — as Florida Attorney General from 2011 to 2019, she had championed anti-trafficking efforts and declared Florida a "zero-tolerance state" while never pursuing the most prominent sex-trafficking case in Florida history, involving a convicted offender living openly in Palm Beach. Now, as U.S. Attorney General, she oversaw a process that released heavily redacted files, indicted no co-conspirators, and transferred the case's most prominent convicted participant to a minimum-security facility.

## Aftermath

The hearing intensified calls for further oversight and raised questions about whether the DOJ was fully complying with the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Democrats promised subpoenas if they gained the House majority in the midterm elections. The DOJ maintained it had released 3.5 million pages of documents, but lawmakers including Khanna and Massie contended this represented, "at best, half the documents."
