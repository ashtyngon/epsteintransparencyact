On August 1, 2025, the Bureau of Prisons transferred Ghislaine Maxwell from Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Tallahassee — a low-security facility — to Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Bryan in Texas, the lowest security classification in the federal prison system. The transfer came just one week after Maxwell held a nine-hour, two-day meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on July 24-25.

## The Facility

FPC Bryan is a minimum-security women's camp near College Station, Texas, housing approximately 635 inmates in a campus-style environment with limited or no perimeter fencing, dormitory housing, and relative freedom of movement. Notable fellow inmates include Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. The facility has been colloquially referred to as "Club Fed."

## Policy Violations

The transfer appeared to violate at least two established Bureau of Prisons policies. Maxwell's conviction on sex trafficking charges triggers a Sex Offender Public Safety Factor requiring placement in at least a low-security facility — minimum-security camps are explicitly excluded for sex offenders. Additionally, with more than 10 years remaining on her 20-year sentence (projected release: July 2037), BOP policy mandates at least low-security placement.

## Whistleblower Revelations

A BOP nurse, Noella Turnage, came forward to House Democrats with evidence of extensive special treatment at FPC Bryan, including customized meals delivered to Maxwell's cell, late-night personal escort to exercise areas, unsupervised laptop access, a service dog in training, and access to staff-only areas. The facility's warden, Tanisha Hall, was reportedly personally helping Maxwell prepare a commutation application to President Trump.

Turnage was fired on November 10, 2025 — one day after Rep. Jamie Raskin wrote to the White House about the whistleblower's findings. A second employee who raised concerns was also terminated.

## Political Fallout

The transfer drew sharp bipartisan criticism. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse demanded BOP documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin accused the administration of "a corrupt misuse of law-enforcement resources." Survivors including Virginia Giuffre's family and accusers Annie and Maria Farmer expressed "horror and outrage."

Attorney General Pam Bondi later told Congress she "learned after the fact" about the transfer and could not say who ordered it. In February 2026, Bondi stated that Maxwell "will hopefully die in prison."
