On September 2, 2025 — the first day Congress returned from summer recess — four Republican House members signed Thomas Massie's discharge petition to force a floor vote on the Epstein Transparency Act. They were the only Republicans to do so, joining all 214 House Democrats.

## The Four Republicans

**Thomas Massie (R-KY)** filed the petition and was its driving force. The libertarian-leaning congressman had co-authored the bill with Rep. Ro Khanna and had been publicly advocating for Epstein transparency for months. He would later say: "We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win."

**Nancy Mace (R-SC)** signed on September 2. A survivor of sexual violence herself, Mace called the issue "deeply personal." She left a meeting with Epstein survivors in tears. Despite intense pressure from the White House to remove her name, she held firm, telling Trump via direct message why she was supporting it and posting publicly that she would "defend every last attack on President Trump to the death" but would "NEVER abandon other survivors."

**Lauren Boebert (R-CO)** signed on September 2. On November 12, in a last-ditch effort, she was brought into a White House Situation Room meeting with AG Pam Bondi, Deputy AG Todd Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel. She refused to withdraw her signature.

**Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)** signed on September 2. In July, she had posted on X that she "will never protect pedophiles or the elites and their circles." Her refusal to back down would lead to one of the most dramatic political breaks of the Trump era.

## White House Response

The administration responded aggressively. The White House distributed a formal statement to media calling Republican support for the petition "a very hostile act to the administration." Trump personally lobbied Boebert and Mace to remove their names. Massie reported that GOP leaders were in "full panic" and had "actually threatened" cosigners — "politically, not physically."

## The 218th Signature

The petition stalled at 217 signatures for weeks as GOP leadership extended the House recess from September through mid-November — seen by supporters as a deliberate delay to prevent the swearing-in of Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ). Arizona's Attorney General sued Speaker Johnson on October 21 to force her swearing-in. On November 12, Grijalva was sworn in and immediately signed as the 218th signature, triggering the floor vote.

The next day, on September 3, Massie and Khanna hosted 10 Epstein survivors at a Capitol Hill press conference — some speaking publicly for the first time — in an event credited with solidifying support for the petition.
