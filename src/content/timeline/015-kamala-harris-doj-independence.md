In December 2025, former Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the Biden administration's handling of the Epstein files during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live — the first time a senior Biden administration official had spoken at length about the decision.

## What Harris Said

When Kimmel asked why the Biden White House had not simply ordered the release of the files, Harris explained the principle directly: "The President of the United States should not be telling the Department of Justice what to investigate, who to prosecute, or what files to release. That is a line we should not cross."

Harris drew on her background as a former prosecutor and California Attorney General: "I spent my career in law enforcement. I know what happens when politicians start directing prosecutions. It doesn't end well for anyone — and it especially doesn't end well for victims."

She framed the distinction clearly: "The question is not whether these files should be released. Of course they should. The question is whether we want a system where the President picks up the phone and tells the Attorney General what to do. Because if we say that's OK when we agree with the outcome, we have to accept it when we don't."

## The Context

Harris's explanation highlighted a genuine institutional difference between the two administrations. The Biden DOJ under Merrick Garland withheld files through established legal processes — citing ongoing investigations, grand jury rules, and appellate proceedings. The Trump DOJ under Pam Bondi released files selectively, with heavy redactions protecting powerful figures while simultaneously leaking survivor identities.

The contrast was not between transparency and secrecy, but between two different failures — one of institutional inertia, one of active political manipulation. The Biden approach used legal process to delay; the Trump approach used selective disclosure to control the narrative while shielding allies.

## Response

Legal scholars and former DOJ officials largely agreed with Harris's description of DOJ independence as a constitutional norm — one that had been repeatedly violated by the Trump administration on other matters. Several noted that the principle had been invoked by attorneys general of both parties going back decades.

Survivors' advocates offered a more nuanced response. While some acknowledged the institutional argument, others noted that transparency and prosecutorial independence are not inherently in conflict — the Biden administration could have supported legislative solutions or executive orders facilitating release without directing specific prosecutorial decisions. The fact that bipartisan legislation ultimately accomplished what both administrations failed to do on their own underscored this point.
