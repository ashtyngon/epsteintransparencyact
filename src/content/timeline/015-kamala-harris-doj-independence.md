In December 2025, following her defeat in the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris addressed the Biden administration's decision not to release Epstein-related federal files during a widely viewed appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. When asked why the files were not released during the Biden presidency, Harris defended the principle of DOJ independence from White House political pressure.

Harris explained that as Vice President — and earlier as a former Attorney General of California and U.S. Senator — she believed the Department of Justice must operate independently from the White House. She stated that the President should not direct the Attorney General to release or withhold specific files for political reasons, framing the issue as one of institutional integrity rather than secrecy.

The comments drew a mixed response. Supporters of Harris's position agreed that maintaining a firewall between the White House and DOJ prosecutorial decisions is a bedrock principle of American governance, one that had been tested during multiple administrations. They pointed out that political interference in DOJ operations had historically led to abuses of power.

Critics, however, argued that the distinction was being used as a shield. They noted that the DOJ's decision to withhold files was itself a discretionary judgment, and that presidential leadership on transparency could have been exercised without compromising specific prosecutorial decisions. Some survivors' advocates expressed frustration, viewing the explanation as insufficient given the years of delay.

The exchange became one of the most-discussed moments in the broader Epstein transparency debate, highlighting the tension between institutional norms and public accountability. It also underscored the political dimensions of the file release issue — which had been a campaign-trail promise from the opposing party and a point of bipartisan public frustration throughout 2024 and 2025.
