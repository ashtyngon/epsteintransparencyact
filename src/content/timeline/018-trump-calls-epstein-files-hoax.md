In a dramatic reversal from his 2024 campaign promise to release the Epstein files, President Trump spent mid-July 2025 aggressively attempting to shut down public interest in the case. The shift came after AG Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche briefed Trump in May 2025 that his name appeared in the Epstein files.

## The Shift

Before the briefing, the administration had been enthusiastic about the files. Bondi said in February that a client list was "sitting on my desk" and in May claimed there were "tens of thousands of videos." But after the briefing, the tone changed completely.

On July 7, the DOJ released a memo stating no "client list" existed and no further releases were warranted. FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino appeared on Fox News and, for the first time, affirmed Epstein died by suicide.

## Trump's Statements

On July 15 at Joint Base Andrews, Trump told reporters he didn't understand why the case "would be of interest to anybody," calling it "pretty boring stuff" and "sordid, but it's boring." He added that "only pretty bad people, including fake news, want to keep something like that going."

On July 16, during a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, Trump declared: "It was a hoax. It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net."

That same day on Truth Social, Trump branded it "the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax" and attacked his own supporters: "My PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker." He called them "weaklings" and wrote: "I don't want their support anymore!"

## Polling Impact

The remarks were politically devastating. A Quinnipiac University poll found only 17% of voters approved of the administration's handling of the Epstein situation, with 63% disapproving. A CNN/SSRS poll found only 3% of Americans described themselves as "satisfied" with the administration's transparency. A YouGov survey found three-quarters of self-identified Republicans thought the government should release all documents.

The backlash from Trump's own base — including prominent MAGA media figures — would intensify through the summer and fall, ultimately contributing to the bipartisan discharge petition that forced the Epstein Transparency Act to a vote.
