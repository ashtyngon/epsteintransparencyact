## The Complaint

In March 2005, a woman contacted the Palm Beach Police Department to report that her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to a mansion in Palm Beach and paid $300 to perform sexual acts on an older man. The address was 358 El Brillo Way, the oceanfront estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The report set in motion what would become one of the most consequential and controversial criminal investigations of the early 21st century.

The case was assigned to Detective Joseph Recarey of the Palm Beach Police Department. Recarey began interviewing the victim, who described being recruited by another young girl and brought to the house to give Epstein a "massage" that escalated into sexual contact. The victim was paid in cash afterward.

## The Investigation

Detective Recarey's investigation quickly expanded far beyond the initial complaint. Through victim interviews and phone records, the Palm Beach Police Department ultimately identified approximately 40 underage girls who had been brought to Epstein's estate. Many described a similar pattern: they were recruited by other girls, promised several hundred dollars for a "massage," and brought to the mansion, where the encounters escalated.

The recruitment operated as a pyramid-style scheme. Girls who had already visited the house were paid $200 to $300 for each new girl they brought in, creating a self-perpetuating network that drew from local high schools. Many of the victims came from disadvantaged backgrounds. The FBI later expanded the number of identified victims to approximately 80.

## The Mansion

The search of 358 El Brillo Way produced extensive physical evidence. Investigators found hidden cameras and recording equipment throughout the property. The mansion contained photographs of nude and partially nude young women and girls. A massage table was found along with sex toys. Detailed phone message logs included the names and phone numbers of dozens of girls. The evidence corroborated victim testimony about the recruitment scheme and the nature of the encounters at the house.

The scope of material recovered pointed to abuse that was systematic and ongoing, not isolated. Records suggested the activity had persisted for years, with victims cycling through the mansion on a regular basis.

## The Referral

As the case developed, Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter grew concerned about the response from the local State Attorney's office. State Attorney Barry Krischer declined to pursue felony charges against Epstein. Instead, Krischer's office offered a single charge of solicitation of prostitution, which would have carried no sex offender registration requirement and minimal jail time.

The Palm Beach Police Department viewed the proposed charge as grossly inadequate given the volume of evidence and the number of underage victims. In a highly unusual step, Chief Reiter bypassed the State Attorney and referred the case directly to the FBI. The FBI's Miami field office opened its own investigation, which was eventually taken up by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida under Alexander Acosta. That federal involvement would lead to the controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement that allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state charges and serve just 13 months in a county jail.
