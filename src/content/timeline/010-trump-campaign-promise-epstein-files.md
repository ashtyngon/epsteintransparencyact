Throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump made the release of Epstein-related files a recurring pledge — one that tapped into deep bipartisan frustration with government secrecy around the case.

## The Promises

The commitment first emerged in June 2024 on Fox & Friends, when Trump told hosts he would "take a look" at releasing Epstein-related files and would do so "for the public."

In September 2024, the pledge became more explicit during Trump's appearance on the Lex Fridman podcast. When Fridman asked directly whether he would release the files, Trump said: "Yeah, I would. I guess I would. I think that less so because of the — you know, I'm not involved — but I do, I think it's a good thing."

The hedge — "I guess I would" — was largely overlooked in the viral clip. The headline was that Trump had committed.

Vice presidential candidate JD Vance went further in October 2024 on the Theo Von podcast, bundling the Epstein files with other transparency promises: "We should release the Epstein files, we should release the JFK files. People have a right to know what their government is hiding."

## Why It Resonated

The promise cut across partisan lines. Transparency advocates, survivors' groups, and media organizations had spent years calling for the release of sealed court records, grand jury materials, and federal investigative files. The Biden DOJ's refusal to release files had frustrated both left and right. Trump's pledge positioned him as the candidate willing to break through institutional resistance.

## What Happened Next

After taking office, the administration initially seemed enthusiastic. AG Pam Bondi said in February 2025 that a client list was "sitting on my desk." In May, she claimed there were "tens of thousands of videos." But after Bondi briefed Trump that his name appeared in the files, the tone changed completely — culminating in Trump calling the entire case "a big hoax" in July 2025.

The gap between the campaign promise and the administration's eventual obstruction became one of the defining political stories of 2025, driving the bipartisan discharge petition that forced the Transparency Act to a vote.
