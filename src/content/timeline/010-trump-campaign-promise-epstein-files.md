Throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump made the release of Epstein-related files a recurring pledge. The promise first emerged publicly in June 2024 during an appearance on Fox & Friends, when Trump said he would "take a look" at releasing Epstein-related files and would do so "for the public."

The pledge gained further traction in September 2024 when Trump appeared on the Lex Fridman podcast. Asked whether he would commit to releasing the files, Trump responded affirmatively, though he hedged by noting that some national security considerations might apply. The exchange went viral, amplifying public demand for transparency.

Vice presidential candidate JD Vance reinforced the commitment in October 2024 during an appearance on the Theo Von podcast, stating that the incoming administration intended to release the Epstein files alongside the JFK assassination files. "We should release the Epstein files, we should release the JFK files," Vance said, positioning both as matters of government transparency.

The campaign promise resonated across the political spectrum, tapping into widespread bipartisan frustration with the perceived secrecy surrounding the Epstein case. Transparency advocates, survivors' groups, and media organizations had long called for the release of sealed court records, grand jury materials, and federal investigative files.

After taking office in January 2025, Trump would sign the Epstein Transparency Act into law on January 7, 2025 — fulfilling the campaign pledge through legislative action with bipartisan congressional support.
