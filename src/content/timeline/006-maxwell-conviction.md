After a month-long trial, a federal jury in Manhattan finds Ghislaine Maxwell guilty on five of six counts, including the most serious charge of sex trafficking of a minor. She would later be sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. The trial provided detailed testimony about the operation of Epstein's network.
