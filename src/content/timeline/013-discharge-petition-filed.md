On September 2, 2025 — the first day Congress returned from summer recess — Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) filed a discharge petition on the House floor to force a vote on the Epstein Transparency Act (H.R. 4501). The bill, co-authored by Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), had stalled after the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan, declined to schedule a markup.

## A Rare Procedural Gambit

A discharge petition is one of the most difficult procedural tools available to rank-and-file members of Congress. It requires the signatures of an absolute majority of the House — 218 out of 435 members — to bypass committee leadership and bring a bill directly to the floor for a vote. Since the modern discharge petition rule was adopted in 1931, more than 600 petitions have been filed. Fewer than 30 have ever obtained the required signatures. Notable successes include the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (McCain-Feingold). The overwhelming majority of discharge petitions fail, making Massie's effort a significant long shot by historical standards.

## Why It Was Necessary

Massie argued that the Judiciary Committee's refusal to advance H.R. 4501 was blocking the will of the majority of House members and the broader public. Despite strong bipartisan co-sponsorship, committee leadership had given no indication that the bill would receive a hearing or a vote. Massie framed the discharge petition as the only remaining path to force transparency on the Epstein case, given institutional resistance from within Congress itself.

## Immediate Momentum

The petition attracted bipartisan support from the moment it was filed. Within the first week, dozens of Republicans and Democrats signed on, driven by constituent pressure, sustained media coverage, and the political salience of the Epstein issue. Advocacy groups and survivors' organizations launched public campaigns urging members of Congress to add their names. Daily signature counts made national headlines, turning what is typically an obscure parliamentary procedure into one of the most closely watched legislative battles in recent congressional history.

The momentum would prove decisive. On November 12, 2025, the petition reached the 218-signature threshold, forcing the bill to the House floor — a rare procedural victory detailed in the following timeline entry.
