On September 2, 2025, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) filed a discharge petition on the House floor to force a vote on the Epstein Transparency Act (H.R. 4501). The procedural move was necessary after the House Judiciary Committee declined to schedule a markup of the bill.

A discharge petition is a rarely successful congressional procedure that requires the signatures of an absolute majority of House members — 218 out of 435 — to bypass committee leadership and bring a bill directly to the floor for a vote. Historically, most discharge petitions fail to gather enough signatures, making Massie's effort a significant gamble.

Massie argued that the Judiciary Committee's inaction was blocking the will of the majority of House members and the American public. He framed the discharge petition as the only available path to force transparency, given institutional resistance from committee leadership.

The petition immediately attracted bipartisan support. Within the first week, dozens of Republicans and Democrats signed on, driven by constituent pressure, media attention, and the political salience of the Epstein issue. Advocacy groups and survivors' organizations launched public campaigns urging members of Congress to sign the petition.

The filing marked the beginning of one of the most closely watched legislative procedural battles in recent congressional history, with daily signature counts making national headlines.
