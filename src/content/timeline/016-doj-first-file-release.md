In late December 2025, the Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi released the first batch of federal records related to Jeffrey Epstein, marking the initial implementation of the Epstein Transparency Act signed into law earlier that year.

The release included investigative memoranda, internal correspondence, and portions of interview records gathered during the federal probe of Epstein. While some material was redacted to protect ongoing investigations and the identities of cooperating witnesses, the volume of disclosed records exceeded many expectations for a first tranche.

Attorney General Bondi framed the release as fulfilling the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. The DOJ announced a rolling release schedule, with additional batches of records to follow as the review board completed its assessment of classified and sensitive materials.

Media organizations, legal analysts, and transparency advocates immediately began reviewing the released documents. Early reporting focused on the scope of the federal investigation, including references to individuals not previously publicly named in connection with the case.

Survivors and their legal representatives welcomed the release as a meaningful first step, while cautioning that the most significant revelations were likely to come in subsequent tranches as the review board worked through more sensitive intelligence and law enforcement materials.

The release marked a historic moment: for the first time, the federal government was proactively disclosing its own investigative files on the Epstein case, moving beyond the civil court documents that had been the primary source of public information up to that point.
