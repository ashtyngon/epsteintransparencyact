In late December 2025, approximately 180 days after the Epstein Transparency Act was signed into law, the Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi released the first tranche of federal records related to Jeffrey Epstein. The release marked the first time the federal government proactively disclosed its own investigative files on the case, moving beyond the civil court documents that had been the primary source of public information.

## The First Release

The DOJ would later claim that the release encompassed 3.5 million pages of documents. The materials included FBI investigation files, internal DOJ communications, and Bureau of Prisons (BOP) records. Some material was classified or marked as related to ongoing investigations. Attorney General Bondi framed the disclosure as fulfilling the administration's commitment to transparency under the new law, and the DOJ announced a rolling release schedule for additional batches as a review board completed its assessment of sensitive materials.

## Redactions and Omissions

Media organizations, legal analysts, and transparency advocates who began reviewing the documents immediately identified a pattern: the released files were heavily redacted, with the names of powerful figures obscured throughout. Lawmakers challenged the completeness of the release. Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Thomas Massie — co-authors of the Transparency Act — contended that the 3.5 million pages represented "at best, half the documents" and that critical intelligence and law enforcement files had been withheld entirely. The absence of materials from agencies such as the CIA and Secret Service drew particular scrutiny, as these agencies were known to possess records relevant to Epstein's activities and associations.

## The Survivor Identity Leak

The most immediate controversy concerned not what was redacted but what was left exposed. Survivor identities were disclosed in the released documents — information that should have been protected under the law. Rep. Massie accused the DOJ of "over-redacting documents while simultaneously leaking survivor identities," calling the outcome "the exact opposite of what the law intended." The leak placed victims at risk of harassment and retaliation, and it contradicted the Transparency Act's explicit mandate to protect survivor privacy while disclosing information about perpetrators and institutional failures.

## Congressional Response

The release triggered sharp bipartisan criticism. Lawmakers noted the paradox at the center of the DOJ's approach: the names of potential co-conspirators and high-profile associates were redacted, while the identities of the people the law was designed to protect were exposed. Democrats promised subpoenas if they gained the House majority in the midterms. Survivors and their legal representatives called on the DOJ to correct the disclosures and implement proper redaction protocols before subsequent releases. The controversy would escalate further in early 2026, when Attorney General Bondi was called before the House Judiciary Committee to answer for the department's handling of the files.
