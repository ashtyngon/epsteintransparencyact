In early January 2026, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) announced her resignation from Congress — the culmination of a dramatic break with President Trump that began when she signed the Epstein files discharge petition on September 2, 2025.

## The Break

Greene had been one of Trump's most vocal and loyal defenders in Congress, building her political identity around aggressive support for the MAGA movement. But when she signed the discharge petition alongside Massie, Mace, and Boebert, she drew Trump's fury.

Trump un-endorsed Greene and attacked her publicly, calling her a "traitor," "wacky," and a "disgrace." The attacks marked a stunning reversal of a political alliance that had defined Greene's career.

## "MAGA Was a Lie"

During the House floor debate on November 18, Greene gave an emotional speech about being called a traitor for demanding accountability for sex trafficking victims. In subsequent public statements, she said the experience had opened her eyes — that "MAGA was a lie" if it meant protecting powerful people at the expense of trafficking survivors.

The remark sent shockwaves through the Republican base. For a figure who had been synonymous with the MAGA brand to publicly declare it a lie over the Epstein issue represented one of the most significant internal fractures in the movement.

## Resignation

Greene announced she would not serve out her term, citing the impossibility of remaining effective in Congress after losing the support of both party leadership and the president. Her resignation was effective in early January 2026.

## Legacy

Greene's break with Trump over the Epstein files became a defining moment in the transparency saga. It demonstrated that the Epstein issue had the power to override even the strongest partisan loyalties, and that survivors' advocacy could move elected officials to take politically costly stands. Her story — from MAGA firebrand to outcast over child trafficking accountability — became one of the most discussed political narratives of 2025.
