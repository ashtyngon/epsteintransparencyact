On July 16, 2025, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) introduced the Epstein Transparency Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bipartisan bill was modeled on the framework of the JFK Records Act of 1992, which mandated the collection and public release of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

The bill required all federal agencies — including the DOJ, FBI, IRS, State Department, and intelligence agencies — to identify, collect, and publicly release any records related to Jeffrey Epstein's activities, his associates, and any investigations into his conduct. It established a review board to oversee the disclosure process and set timelines for release.

Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican known for his transparency advocacy, had been one of the earliest congressional voices calling for the release of Epstein files. Khanna, a progressive Democrat from California, brought bipartisan credibility to the effort and helped attract Democratic cosponsors.

The bill drew broad support from transparency organizations, survivors' advocates, and media outlets. However, it initially faced institutional resistance. The House Judiciary Committee did not schedule a markup, prompting Massie to pursue an alternative procedural strategy — the discharge petition — to bring the bill directly to the House floor without committee approval.

The legislative effort reflected widespread public frustration with the federal government's handling of Epstein-related information and the perception that powerful interests were being shielded from accountability.
