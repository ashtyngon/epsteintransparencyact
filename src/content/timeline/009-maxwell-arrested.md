Nearly a year after Jeffrey Epstein's death in federal custody, FBI agents arrested Ghislaine Maxwell at a secluded property in Bradford, New Hampshire, where she had been living in hiding. Maxwell was charged with six federal counts, including conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and perjury.

The indictment alleged that between 1994 and 1997, Maxwell helped Epstein recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse minor girls, some as young as 14. Federal prosecutors described Maxwell as playing a critical role in Epstein's operation — befriending victims, normalizing abusive behavior, and at times directly participating in the abuse.

Maxwell had largely disappeared from public view after Epstein's arrest in July 2019. Her capture was one of the most high-profile arrests in the broader Epstein case and represented a major step in the government's pursuit of accountability. She was denied bail multiple times and remained in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn until her trial.

The arrest marked a turning point: for the first time, a key member of Epstein's inner circle was facing federal criminal prosecution. Maxwell's subsequent trial would become one of the most closely watched proceedings in the Epstein saga.
