Between 2007 and 2008, U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, who led the federal prosecutor's office in Miami, negotiated a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein's defense team that would become one of the most controversial plea deals in modern American history.

## The Federal Investigation

The FBI's investigation had identified at least 36 underage victims. Federal prosecutors had assembled a 53-page indictment that could have sent Epstein to prison for life on federal sex trafficking charges. The case appeared strong and was ready for prosecution.

## The Deal

Instead of pursuing federal charges, Acosta's office struck a deal. Under the NPA, Epstein would plead guilty to two minor Florida state prostitution charges — soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. In exchange:

- All potential federal charges were dropped
- Epstein's unnamed co-conspirators were granted immunity from federal prosecution
- Epstein would serve just 18 months in the Palm Beach County Stockade (he served 13)
- He was granted work release, allowing him to leave jail six days a week, 12 hours a day
- The agreement was kept secret from the victims, violating their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act

## The Victims

The deal was made without consulting or notifying the victims, in direct violation of federal law. When survivors eventually learned of the agreement, they challenged it in court. In 2019, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors had indeed violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act — but by then, the statute of limitations on many potential charges had expired.

## Why It Mattered

The NPA's immunity provision for co-conspirators was particularly significant. It effectively shielded anyone else involved in Epstein's operation from federal prosecution, closing the door on what could have been a broader investigation into his network. This immunity clause would become a central focus of scrutiny when the deal was later exposed by the Miami Herald's "Perversion of Justice" investigation.

Acosta would later claim he was told to "leave it alone" because Epstein "belonged to intelligence," a remark that fueled widespread speculation about Epstein's connections to government agencies — speculation that has never been fully resolved.
