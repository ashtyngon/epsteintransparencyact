Jeffrey Epstein is arrested by FBI-NYPD task force agents at Teterboro Airport upon his return from Paris. He is charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleges that Epstein sexually abused dozens of underage girls at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach between 2002 and 2005. He pleads not guilty and is denied bail.
