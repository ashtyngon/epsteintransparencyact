In the days following Trump's declaration that the Epstein files were "a big hoax" and his attacks on supporters demanding transparency, a wave of prominent MAGA-aligned media figures publicly broke with the president on the issue — a rare fracture in the Trump media ecosystem.

## Joe Rogan

Podcast host Joe Rogan delivered the most widely circulated rebuke, accusing the Trump administration of "gaslighting" supporters. Rogan called the FBI's dismissal of sex trafficking evidence "the gaslightiest gaslighting s*** I've ever heard in my life" and described the Epstein issue as "a line in the sand." Given Rogan's enormous audience and his perceived influence on the 2024 election, his criticism was seen as particularly significant.

## Other MAGA Figures

Alex Jones, who had been among Trump's earliest and most vocal supporters, pushed back aggressively. Tucker Carlson raised pointed questions about the administration's reversal. Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, expressed skepticism about the DOJ's claim that no client list existed. Comedian and podcast host Andrew Schulz said Trump was "insulting our intelligence."

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), a Trump ally who would later sign the discharge petition, wrote: "The American people deserve and can handle the truth. Let's see the files."

## Significance

The MAGA media backlash was historically unusual. Trump had maintained near-total loyalty from right-wing media through multiple controversies, including two impeachments and a criminal conviction. The Epstein files represented one of the first issues where prominent figures in his own media ecosystem publicly challenged him — and sustained that challenge over months rather than backing down.

The backlash created political space for the four Republican House members — Thomas Massie, Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, and Marjorie Taylor Greene — to sign the discharge petition in September 2025, knowing they had grassroots support even if they were defying party leadership.
