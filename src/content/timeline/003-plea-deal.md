On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein entered a guilty plea in Florida state court to two charges: one count of solicitation of prostitution and one felony count of procurement of minors for prostitution. The plea was the culmination of a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) signed on September 24, 2007, between Epstein's defense team and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, led by Alexander Acosta.

## The Federal Investigation

The FBI's investigation into Epstein had identified at least 36 underage victims. Federal prosecutors had assembled a 53-page indictment that carried the potential of a life sentence on federal sex trafficking charges. The case was considered strong, with extensive victim testimony and corroborating evidence gathered over more than a year of investigation.

## The Deal

Under the terms of the NPA, all potential federal charges against Epstein were dropped. In their place, Epstein faced only the two Florida state charges. The agreement's key provisions included:

- A sentence of 18 months in the Palm Beach County Stockade (Epstein ultimately served 13 months)
- Work release privileges six days a week, 12 hours per day, at the Florida Science Foundation, an Epstein-linked nonprofit located on Royal Palm Way in Palm Beach
- Federal immunity for unnamed co-conspirators, effectively foreclosing broader investigation into Epstein's network
- A requirement that Epstein register as a sex offender

The deal was kept secret from the victims, a decision that would later be found to violate federal law.

## The Legal Team

Epstein assembled one of the most formidable defense teams ever convened for a criminal case. His attorneys included Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law professor and prominent appellate advocate; Kenneth Starr, the former independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton; Jay Lefkowitz, a former White House adviser; Gerald Lefcourt, a veteran New York criminal defense lawyer; and Martin Weinberg, a Boston-based trial attorney. Jack Goldberger served as local counsel in Palm Beach. The team drew on resources from Kirkland & Ellis, one of the nation's largest law firms. The sheer concentration of legal talent applied pressure on prosecutors and signaled Epstein's willingness to wage an extended, costly legal battle.

## The Victims

The 36 identified victims were not consulted or notified about the plea agreement, as required under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (18 U.S.C. 3771). Attorneys Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell filed suit on behalf of two victims, challenging the NPA's secrecy. The legal fight over victim notification would continue for more than a decade. In February 2019, Judge Kenneth Marra of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled that federal prosecutors had violated the CVRA by failing to inform the victims before finalizing the agreement. By that time, however, the statute of limitations on many potential federal charges had long expired.

## The Aftermath

Epstein served his sentence under conditions that bore little resemblance to incarceration. During work release, he was chauffeured to the Florida Science Foundation office, where he spent up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, outside the stockade. After his release, he resumed his life in Palm Beach and New York, required only to register as a sex offender.

The plea deal attracted relatively little national attention at the time. It was not until the Miami Herald published its "Perversion of Justice" investigation in November 2018 that the full scope of the NPA's terms — and the scale of the underlying allegations — became widely known. That reporting reignited public outrage and ultimately contributed to Epstein's rearrest by federal prosecutors in New York on July 6, 2019.
