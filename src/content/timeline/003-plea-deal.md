Jeffrey Epstein pleads guilty to two state prostitution charges in Florida as part of a controversial non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors. The deal, negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, allowed Epstein to serve 13 months in a county jail with work release privileges rather than face federal charges. The agreement would later be widely criticized as excessively lenient.
